Faris and I have threaded together a written text (narrative poem), visual text (images of <i>gijichon</i>), and spoken text (academic research) to create a polyphonic portrait of this landscape.

Archiving </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> introduces a dilemma that is directly related to the function of an archive. Archiving, or writing history, is in itself already an activity </span><span style="font-weight:400">predicated on the acts of exclusion. It has to decide what has to be included and what has to be left out. So, creating an archive regarding this erased memory site proposes a representational problem in which one must continuously be conscious of the responsibilities regarding </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">what</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">how</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> to represent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">As a polyphonic account of a polytemporal experience, </span><span style="font-weight:400">this project experiments with the</span><span style="font-weight:400"> ways in which writing can be done to visually reflect the pasts present, and presents past.</span><span style="font-weight:400"> This project relies on</span><span style="font-weight:400"> two axes, one personal and the other historical. Each fragment of writing is dated. </span><span style="font-weight:400">The personal axis consists of </span><span style="font-weight:400">my experience dating an American soldier, the field trips I took outside Seoul to different </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">s, about the time I was offered a job in a </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> and about the time when I actually did work as a “bartender” at a bar serving drinks to old men and letting them fondle me for tips. The historical axis consists of various representations of <em>gijichon</em>, in literature and in journalism. The biggest component of this axis is </span><span style="font-weight:400">old newspaper articles corresponding to the date of my personal experience. </span><span style="font-weight:400">Between the personal and the historical, this project thinks of the ways in which the histories that are not immediately mine come into my experience in the present, which not only politicizes the personal but redefines the personal as ultimately palimpsestuous. Lastly, departing from authorized narratives of that past, this intimate rewriting of pasts present navigates between collective amnesia and aphasia: things are perhaps never forgotten but made ungraspable amidst the opacity of palimpsests.</span></p>

She makes a whole variety of them. Cucumber kimchi in the summer, and water kimchi with flowered carrots for festive occasions. When she is open for sale, my mom decorates her </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Kakaostory</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> with pictures of her at the market picking out vegetables. She posts explaining each ingredient and whose hands were responsible for them to get to her kitchen counter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">A week or two after she’s made a new batch of scallion kimchi, we put pork belly on the pan. Take a lettuce leaf and start loading; a small spoonful of rice, a piece of pork belly, a slice of raw or roasted garlic, some </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">ssamjang</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, and a bit of the kimchi. Stuffing ourselves with these wraps of fragile green leaves, all we really talk about is how much pork belly Uly, my dog, should be allowed to eat. All I want to think or say seems to slip away from me, washed down with cold cans of beer. We’re filling our stomachs. And on the table devoid of any meaningful conversation, the sizzling and the crunching fill that peculiar silence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">I don’t necessarily get along with my mom, but I always do with the things she chose to feed me. Especially her kimchi, because it’s really, too good. But before the taste, what comes into my mind first is always the color. The bright red color. It’s never a devilish red though, its redness does not scream spicy, salty, nor fishy. It’s fiery, but it’s also soft. It’s a red that is transparent and optimistic. It is a red that invites then assures. The </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">gochugaru</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> she uses is quite special: she has this number she hits up when she needs it; the guy shows up in a car with dark windows; and he does not take tikkie. Depending on the kimchi, she will use apples or pears, sometimes both. When she’s in the mood my mom also puts little strands of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">chopi</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> fruits. In her winter cabbage kimchi, she adds chopped pieces of raw hairtail fish. The fish gets kind of cured in the pot; the kimchi gives some to the fish, and the fish gives some of itself to the kimchi. In the end the fish becomes this nutty thing. For the fish sauce, she prefers the ones made with small sand eels, over those with anchovies. Sand eels are green. And its fermented form, so extremely fermented that the fish is no longer decipherable, definitely smells disgusting. Yet in the kimchi, it disappears; only leaving this unmistakable trace, a subtle freshness. A fermentation layered over another. Layers of time. Again, lay this kimchi on your spoonful of rice. Maybe layer it with a piece of hairtail. On top of a seaweed paper. Stuff yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">I don’t necessarily get along with my mom, in fact, I am disgusted by my parents when I talk about them over my therapist’s desk. I remember that one summer evening we went to an eels barbeque. I don’t like eels. That evening I saw my dad for the first time in 37 hours, and that 37 hours ago he had called me something. Sitting on the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">jungja </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">outside the apartment, I told my mom to please fuck off. I don’t want anything to do with them. I said I cannot live with the memories of the family. All the layers of time they brought into my life when they brought me into my life. Crying. Begging. Let me go. I hate those layers, just please fuck off from everything. The next morning, I went to therapy, then spent the day staring at a wall in Starbucks chewing on bananas. But when I faced them at that table, I had to eat. Sizzle and crunch. What cute thing did Uly do today? Everything slips away. Really, eels are too slimy. Against my repulsion, against my desperate clinging onto my hatred—like the fish sauce, the disgust becomes something else. I evaporate. What is left in my mouth is something that is unforgettable yet traceless. Traceless like the fish sauce; but absolutely nothing is subtle. Nothing is fresh in my mouth. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">There are a million different types of kimchi and there are about half a million things that can go into it. Salt and sugar for pickling. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Aekjeot</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> of all kinds of sea animals, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">gochugaru</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, garlic, giner, onion, scallion, chives, radish, apple, pears, rice… But if you asked my mom what the most important ingredient is, I know she will say time. Time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">It is only after the right amount of time that the pot of kimchi can be opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">I am never sure what kind of a woman my mom is. I don’t know about her past dreams and her future aspirations. I am utterly ignorant about the ways she deals with her sadness or loneliness. I wonder if she truly enjoys her lunch dates with </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">ajummas</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> with colorful Birkins and stories of their lawyer daughters and in-laws. I wonder how those stories make her feel about her own daughter, who left to … where? Netherlands? New Zealand?, and who keeps dating boys too colorful for her own taste. I don’t know what her fun looks like. Or maybe I do, but simply unable or unwilling to relate. I don’t understand why she never left my dad, although she regularly says she will. I wonder if it is similar to the way she regularly says she will get an eye lift but never does. I wonder if that’s what love is. I wonder if forgiveness is indispensable in the way she loves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">I wonder what she thinks when she makes kimchi. I wonder where her little smile comes from, each time we eat at her table. I wonder if that coffee she goes to drink after my dad’s manic fit makes her really feel better. Because it doesn’t make me feel any better. Because after each coffee, after each “I am never coming back,” she always comes home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Maybe I know all the answers but I don’t want to. How many layers of time will I have to travel through? When will I open?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">It has been almost two years since I moved to Amsterdam. I’m going home in May. I already know my mom will put some crazy shit across the table for me the evening of my arrival. Neatly laid out on the table, the rice next to the soup. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Banchan</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> around the main dish. Freshly cut kimchi. Cold cans of beer. </span><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">Pretty dishes neatly arranged, unlike the memories layered over my chest, my head, and my present. We will know just by the appearance, the food on the table is good. We will sit down and sizzle, crunch, chew, swallow. We understand this is good food, this is a good time. But perhaps we will never understand each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Or perhaps, just perhaps, we understand each other too much. Making it impossible to love. But also impossible to not love.</span></p></div><div class="text-section text"><p><span style="font-weight:400">17 March 2022</span></p>

The article mentions a certain Mr. Kang, a war refugee who ended up in the South with his eight family members. He is described as “unspeakably poor.” Their journey to fight hunger is detailed as the following: “His sister and grandchildren go to the garbage disposal site at the US military base, to pick up potato peels, breadcrumbs, and leftover canned meat. This is not easy; as there are always tens of other women there fighting for better trash. Kang’s family must go there everyday from early in the morning to late in the afternoon, if they want to eat. They must rigorously search through the garbage bins. In Mr. Kang’s neighborhood of Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, there are 7 families (25 people in total) who entirely depend on American garbage for food.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">On the night of 9 February 1964, a boy named Changgook Huh leaves home around 21:00. He was twelve years old at the time—he would have been born in the same year as when Mr. Kang’s sister was lurking around American garbage bins, when the war was at a deadly stalemate where people were dying of hunger and not of bullets. Changgook does not return home that night. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Dong-A Ilbo</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> reports on the 11th that he is hospitalized at 43rd US Field Hospital after being hit by one of the two shots a nameless private had fired. It is said that he “crossed the fence into the base of First Corporation, B Company, 51th Signal Battalion, located in Uijeongbu” to “scavenge breadcrumbs and ingredients for </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">kkulkkulijuk</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">.” He was shot while running away, after being caught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">In November 1968, Richard Nixon wins his second term of presidency. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Kyunghyang Shinmun</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> publishes an article on the victory of this man who “enjoys listening to Beethoven.” The article ends on a hopeful note, bringing forward Nixon’s apparent pro-South Korea tendencies. It says, “He has always been friendly to Korea, even tasting </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">kkulkkulijuk </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">in Dongdaemun Market.” If he eats American garbage like we do, that must mean he supports us, right?</span></p></div></div></div> <div class="page-index">

But no matter.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">Jungcheon died on the 6th of September, 2021. He lived 94 years. His death meant nothing to my reality: I was in Amsterdam, he died on a hospital bed in Seoul. Jungcheon’s absence only took shape a few weeks ago, when I learned that after his death, Duckwon cries when she has to be alone. They spent 70 years together. Duckwon cries like I cry in Amsterdam, unable to deal with a suffocating loneliness. But I am 28 and she is 90 years old, she can’t exactly go do things. She has become so small. As life is leaving her body, she looks more and more like a dried anchovy. She sits in her huge apartment in her small body. All she does all day is waiting to die. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">I mostly had an immense sense of FOMO that week of Jungcheon’s death. I wanted to see my brother carry Jungcheon’s picture at the front of the march, and my friends carrying the casket to the limousine that took Jungcheon’s body and the family to the crematory. Most of all I wanted to see Duckwon crying over the coffin in her Issey Miyake dress, somehow standing on her tiny tiny ankles. I am not sure why her outfit left such an impression on me. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is a type of white water kimchi that consists mostly of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> and brine. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Mu</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is a root vegetable, and</span><i><span style="font-weight:400"> </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">is similar to what we call daikon radish. It is shorter and fatter. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Mu</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is a very self-protective vegetable. The thickness of the skin on an autumn </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> might tell you how cold that year’s winter might be. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Dong</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> means winter and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">chimi</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is an old word for kimchi. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Dongchimi </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">is a winter kimchi served in a small bowl. We drink the brine and eat the pieces of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. Because it is a winter kimchi, it is characteristic of the colder northern regions of Korea. Food is traditionally milder there. So </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is white—not red—and when it’s on the table, it means it’s winter. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">Jungcheon was a smart man whose life was not so much about living, but more about surviving the circumstances he found himself in. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">There are several </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">naengmyeon </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">restaurants in Seoul, and most of them are very old. By old, I mean they’ve existed since before the war, or came into existence shortly after the war. I don’t really like </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> so I haven’t gone since I was quite young. And my memories of the clientele there were that those men were as old as the restaurants themselves. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is the food of the North Korean diaspora in South Korea. The specific type of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> I am most familiar with comes from Pyongyang. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is not cheap to make: the form that is established in South Korea is its older version, before the North Korean Famine: because restaurant owners came to the South before the famine. The newer version tastes and looks quite different, I heard. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Naeng</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> means cold, and </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">myeon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is noodles. They come in thin metal bowls with slices of meat, a half of a boiled egg, and pickled </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> and/or cucumbers. Topped with some green onions and a bit of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">gochugaru</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. Depending on the restaurant, it might also contain pheasant meatballs. The noodles are grayish brown, made with buckwheats. These noodles are long, they are not cut. The servers would cut them with scissors once it’s served. Everything in the bowl is cold: like ice in the broth or the broth itself would be like a slushy. The broth is a mixture of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">dongchimi </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">and beef stock, and because it is served cold, every hint of fat has been skimmed. It is so fucking mild, like it does not have taste. But you must, I am told, breathe… I don’t know if I don’t breathe when I eat other types of noodles, but apparently with </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, you must breathe with your nose gently to feel the scent of the buckwheat and the slightest taste of the broth. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed when Jungcheon was 18 years old. He was born in Pyongyang, and there was no such thing as North Korea then. After the bombings, the Japanese, in defeat, left Korea and suddenly that impoverished land was free. The landscape on this peninsula was changing rapidly and it was already divided along the 38th parallel. But his entire family was able to simply walk across and move to the South. Jungcheon was 23 years old when the war broke out. But he never fought. At the beginning of the war, Jungcheon was a student at Seoul National University. Going to that school meant so much at the time, and it still does now. People had no time for school at the time, they were digging US military’s garbage bins. But Jungcheon was digging into engineering books at the most prestigious university, founded by the Japanese Empire. Towards the end of the war, he was a math teacher at a high school. One day, all the teachers were lined up and were to be taken somewhere to be enlisted as soldiers. He ran away from the queue. He later became a professor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">Daddy issues are like a locket, a heirloom, an everlasting inheritance my family carries generation after another. Kyeseon was Jungcheon’s father, and he hated his son. Suk is Jungcheon’s son, and Suk did not particularly love his father either. Kyeseon didn’t like Jungcheon because Jungcheon was born from another woman. And Jungcheon was never satisfied with Suk because Suk never got into Seoul National University. When Jungcheon was young—living through colonial-postcolonial-war-postwar times—he decided that you might as well die if you were stupid. And if you didn’t go to Seoul National University, you were stupid. Maybe he thought only by his smartness can he be acknowledged as a worthwhile son, still worthy to be fed. I am not sure. Jungcheon was anxious that his son would be a failure. But the war was already over more than 20 years ago, and while terrible things were still happening on this land, Jungcheon was rich enough now to not be affected and Suk was reckless enough to not care. Suk did not want to prove much. Times of proving oneself were over. Suk never got into Seoul National University. Their relationship was conflicted until Jungcheon died. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">At Jungcheon’s funeral Suk said two sentences. “My father was a man who loved more than he ever received. Thank you for coming.” </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight:400">When Jungcheon was still breathing, he really liked to breathe into </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. It was his favorite thing to breathe into. Jungcheon was so particular about it. He will order it at room temperature, which is called </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">guhnaeng</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. No ice. Once it’s on the table, he will never, ever cut the noodles. It will offend him. He will first drink the broth, almost two thirds of it. Then, he adds vinegar and mustard. The noodles will never not be in his mouth; one end of the strand in his throat, the other still in the bowl. Breathing through his nose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">After Jungcheon died I had this brilliant idea of making </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. I went with my boyfriend to Shilla, the only Korean grocery store in Amsterdam. I was looking for </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">mu </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">for </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. It was October, and the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">s were not fat: the weather wasn’t hostile enough for </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> to have to protect itself. We also went to Hema to buy a big plastic box to put </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, I planned to leave it outside while it’s fermenting. Following my mom’s directions, I made the brine and salted the vegetables. I closed the box and put it on my balcony. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">When I opened it after a few weeks, it was moldy. I was very disappointed. I closed it and left it outside where it was sitting. I never opened it, until I threw it out a few weeks ago. It was rotting there for months. All blue and green. Corpse-y.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Last time I talked to Jungcheon, he asked me about the weather in Amsterdam. Then he told me to eat well and stay healthy. The weather in Amsterdam was not cold enough to leave the </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> outside. The only cold thing I eat there is ice cream, when I’m high or hung over. </span></p></div></div></div> <div class="page-index">

In this sense, memories are palimpsestuous, as they are always reconstituted individually and collectively. Memories also fluctuate between omissions and exaggerations, mutate as they encounter different contexts, and haunt to shape the present. Memories have the critical and political potential to create ruptures in established historical narratives, through which a different narrative can enter. In examining this potential, Peter Verovšek states that “memory is needed to sustain the constructive power of individuals and unique human beings within self-consciously defined communities” (6). “The constructive power” here refers to the communicative political power that defines an “actor or a group in a social setting” (5), which arises from the sense of being within a certain group, rather than that of doing certain things. By this definition, memories become the bedrock of certain communities, built upon shared experiences. Then, circulating memories within a society reconstructs communities, and through the very circulation, the legitimacy of the communities and their shared pasts is established and actualized.</span></p>

The spatial setting of the novel, the Overlook hotel, is a place where the past and the present are indistinguishable. Focusing on this inseparable timeframes, this thesis pays attention to the process in which the past and the present becomes destructed through writing, and the ways in which reading can lead the hauntings of the past into a different future. Firstly, this thesis redefines the father-son relationship between Jack and Danny Torrance as that of the writer as a reader. Defining Jack’s death in terms of Roland Barthes’ “The Death of the Author” (1967), this thesis locates the source of Jack’s death in his possessive desire to own and represent the past. However, the past is already in the present, making ‘re-presentation,’ an act of bringing the past into the present </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">again</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, is impossible. Secondly, this thesis anlayzes Danny’s shining ability as a reading ability. The shining ability which renders Danny a vision for the past and the future, is defined as the ability to carefully read the unstable signifiers. Danny does not share his father’s possessive desire for representation and survives from the Overlook hotel as a reader. This survival gives him a chance to continue his life in the future. However, this thesis pays attention to the fact that Tony, Danny’s future self, is already haunted by the past. The name of Tony comes from Danny’s abusive grandfather Anthony, and the undesirable past is repeated in the form of the name-inheritance. Lastly, if the signifier of the future is already haunted by the past, the only way to produce newness for the future is to read the past in different ways. This thesis concludes that Danny can read the past in ways that has not been done before, and that he can open up a future that is different from the past, through such reading. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">The following is an excerpt from the Introduction of the thesis. The full text is available on riss.kr</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight:400">        The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> defines “represent” as “bring into one’s presence; bring before the mind; [...] RE + PRESENT” (“represent”). The prefix ‘re-’ indicates something “with the sense ‘again’” (“re-”). “Present” derives from “presence,” which means “make [something] present” (“presence”). Going further, “presence” is constituted by “PRE + sēns,”: ‘pre,’ “before” (“pre-”) and ‘sēns,’ “feel” (“sense”). Therefore, representation, in terms of writing, refers to the act of making a past feeling come into presence again by reconstructing that feeling with words. It is interesting that none of the definitions of the fragments that make up the word ‘represent’ are rooted in palpable reality. It is the “sense” of something present, rather than the ‘fact’ that is being re-presented. Already in its etymology, this word that has been problematized from Plato through Roland Barthes to Jacques Derrida is exuding a sense of hauntedness. The word ‘representation,’ in that it is rooted in senses, can easily be explained as an act of re-presenting a feeling that has passed, but somehow remaining in traces, to present it again in the here and now. The act of representation is shaped by the desire to restore the senses of the past into a text; and what is represented is haunted by such senses that surface in the writing process. Therefore, writing, if it is indeed an act of mimesis, cannot be discussed apart from the haunting of the past, or temporalities in general. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>This thesis, reading Stephen King’s 1977 novel </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> as an allegory of Roland Barthes’ “The Death of an Author,” <span style="text-decoration:line-through">##(1)##</span> reconsiders the father-son relationship of Jack and Danny Torrance as that of a writer and a reader. Jack Torrance is an aspiring writer, and Danny is a reader who has just begun to learn how to read. While Jack is destroyed in his obsession to write about the history of the Overlook, Danny survives the haunting powers of that history by reading it in collaboration/cooperation with his mother Wendy, and the head chef of the hotel Dick Hallorann. All three characters who survive have a special ability called ‘shining,’ which I define as fundamentally the ability to read constantly shifting and mutating signifiers that consist of the seemingly unreadable textuality of the hotel. Ultimately, this thesis aims to interrogate how </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> warns against the possessive writing of the past, and appeal to the responsibility of the reader in rearranging the signifiers of the past in the present so that it opens up the possibility of moving forward into the future. In this sense, the future is a rereading of the past. The past is already haunting the present, as deeply embedded and vividly resuscitated in the haunted present of the Overlook hotel. What is not so apparent is the ways in which </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> depicts the future as a reflection of the past. Investigating this closely interconnected relationship between the past, the present, and the future, this thesis concludes that the collective and flexible reading of signifiers is a key to reading the past and regenerate its meaning in the present to take us into the future.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight:400">        The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> captures the horrors that derive from the unforgotten past which haunts the present, and with the two central characters being a writer and a reader put in the midst of those horrors, exemplifies a situation where the representational activities cannot be separated from temporalities. Indeed, in any representational experience, it is apparent that the text being read in the present has originally been produced in the past. Going back to the hauntedness of representation itself, the text produced in the past in turn embodies in itself the traces of other pasts. Furthermore, because any reading generates interpretations, reading can be understood as a kind of (re)writing. Then, a text produced in the past is not only just read in the present, but it is simultaneously to be reconstituted and rewritten in the future and for the future, although the moment of original inscription would be irrecoverably lost. As such, every text is palimpsestuous. A palimpsest, which means a manuscript or a piece of writing on which old writings have been covered by new writings, serves as an appropriate metaphor in understanding the peculiar timeframe inherent in any literary text. The process of writing and reading the text creates an arena where layers of signs of the past, present, and the future at once come to be accumulated and eventually lose differences from one another. Signifiers are sedimented, and the future can only be imagined in that same arena where the past has an irrepressible existence. In this sense, literary works are inseparably linked to the concepts of time: they are haunted by what has been written, what is being written, and what will be written by all subjects who encounter a text. This is how a text, like an organic being with an agency of its own, comes to trespass and deconstruct the supposed divisions of the past, present, and the future. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>Accordingly, this thesis explores the question of presentation revolving around the two axes. One is that of the reading and writing, and the other is that of timeframes. As reading, in its production of interpretations, becomes a form of writing, the binary in the axis of reading-writing can no longer be sustained. They are not dichotomously opposing categories, and activities that happen simultaneously. An evident example is Jack’s writing of the Overlook’s history, which originated in his reading of the haunted hotel’s complex and concealed past. Another is Danny’s reading of signs that are given to him through the shining, such as REDRUM that he eventually reads it as a murder of himself and Wendy by Jack but comes to write it anew as that of his father. The axis of timeframes is revealed to be all haunted by the past. The past persists into the present at the Overlook, as past events, like the masquerade of 1945, reoccur over and over during the Torrances’ stay at the hotel. Also, Jack’s abusive past, such as breaking Danny’s arm in a violent fit of anger, repeat in different forms during their stay. Ultimately, this axis of the past, the present, and the future intersects with the aforementioned axis of reading and writing, because the indistinguishability of reading (the text of the past) and writing (generating new meanings into the future) opens up the possibility that the repetition of the past can be read in different ways by rearranging the signifiers of the past in ways otherwise unknown in the past. In this sense, reading and writing repeat the haunting of the past yet expand it in different directions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>While defining </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> as a Gothic text is not the central concern of this thesis, it is necessary to situate the issues of deconstructed reading and writing through timeframes in this novel in terms of ‘horror.’ Perhaps what can define </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> as a Gothic text is its blatant presence of ghosts. In </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Literature of Terror</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> (1996), David Punter argues that “the elements which seem most universal in the [Gothic] genre are the apparent presence of a ghost” (12). The ghost, who is a revenant from the past, is a representative embodiment of the haunting of the past in the present. Punter, further trying to define gothic literature, argues that “the Gothic [has] a way of relating to the real, to historical and psychological facts,” which is why “Gothic fiction has, above all, to do with terror” (12). Gothic, then, has to do with the terror in the idea of the unending past, past that is indistinguishable from the present. This comes to attest that what is terrifying in gothic literature is the persistence and the return of the past. However, the fact that the idea of the past should invoke terror fundamentally suppresses ‘the other,’ as the past, what is not in the present myself is also a form of the other. This other, the past, constantly invading my present is terrifying, and should be sublimated. By the definition of ‘representation,’ the suppression of the other that does not belong in the presence is an impossible project in literature: the word already embraces in itself the bombardment of what has passed. In this sense, I argue that the Gothic representation has, above all, to do with deconstruction. It is time to embrace, not terrorize, the deconstructions Gothic fiction has been depicting. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>Scholars locate the horror in Stephen King as arising from a certain anxiety about how one thing may not be the thing it seems to be. Regarding King and horror fiction, Bernard J. Gallagher argues that “the insight which King offers into the work of horror is based upon a bimodal or dualistic vision which insists upon the necessity of reading between lines” (37). The “dualistic vision” refers to the conventional notion of representation in which a thing is either articulatable or not and it, if the latter, has to be adjusted or compromised according to an acceptable ways of understanding so as to be articulated. However, I do not regard </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> as a novel that is dictated by such “bimodal” logic. The ghosts in </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> appear to the characters in the form of their grotesque, terrifying faces, bodies, and voices. As such, they seem to be recognizable in terms of our conventionally Gothic understanding of them as ghosts. Yet, those ghosts are not fully adjusted or compromised in the conventional gothic manner. What they truly signify is much more than how they look on the surface. Furthermore, the relationship between the signifier and the signified at the Overlook is not one to one. It is one to many. Signifiers are unregulated, unpredictable, and explosive at this haunted hotel. This is why I maintain that what lies at the core of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is the deconstruction of the process in writing and reading. Gary Hoppenstand and Ray B. Browne argue that, “in </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, the supernatural motif of the novel is the haunted hotel, but the actual </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">horror</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> elements of the story center more with the disintegration of the Torrance family” (6). Yet what causes that “disintegration of the Torrance family” is the already latent yet increasingly intensified conflict between the writer-Jack and the reader-Danny regarding how to comprehend the “horror elements” that are the ghostly signifiers of the hotel. Indeed, as Heidi Strengell argues, “King has been so concerned with ontology that he constantly writes about multidimensional worlds, universes within universes” (19). While the multidimensional world of significances is how the haunting is represented at the Overlook, in the form of mutative timeframes embodied in signifiers, what I read from </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is not so much a “concern” about ontological stability of things, but how a deliberate reading of unstable signifiers can be a means of precarious yet ontological survival itself amidst the inescapable powers of the past. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>Despite its limitation, it is important to reflect upon the deconstructive and reconstructive implication of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> in relation with Gothic fiction because the genre has been characterized by doubles and binaries. The issue of this dichotomy is crucial in terms of writing, as the division between the representable and the unrepresentable dictates the logic of representation in Gothic novels. In her decisive work </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Coherency of Gothic Conventions</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> (1980), Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argues that the futile force trying to reunite the split back into its original unified form is the most vital drive in the Gothic novel. She argues,</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>The self and whatever it is that is outside have a proper, natural, necessary connection to each other, but one that the self is suddenly incapable of making. The inside life and the outside life have to continue separately, becoming counterparts rather than partners, the relationship between them one of parallels and correspondences rather than communication. This, though it may happen in an instant, is a fundamental reorganization, creating a doubleness where singleness should be. And the lengths there are to go to reintegrate the sundered elements</span><span style="font-weight:400">—finally, the impossibility of restoring them to their original oneness—are the most characteristic energies of the Gothic novel</span><span style="font-weight:400">. (13)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>The spatial division of the inside and outside cannot be unified in Gothic literature, and Sedgwick identifies the Freudian psychoanalysis as the locus of such dichotomous critical convention of the genre. She says: “[i]n congruence with this [i.e. divided between the inner and the outer] map of the self, critics of the Gothic, and not only those who describe themselves as psychoanalytic, find it easy to group together on the one hand the surface, reason, and repression and on the other the depths, the irrational, and the sexual” (142). However, I stress that, in </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, it is not the “repression” that leads to unrepresentability. It is the always-already haunting presence of the past that makes representation impossible: naturally, one cannot bring into presence what is already present. Again, the binary between the representable and the unrepresentable in </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> is deconstructed by the inherent persistence of the past. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>Reading and writing through the layers of time, the reader and the writer come to be in“separately” related to one another. Putting Sedgwick’s argument in terms of reading and writing, writing can be equated to the “inside life” which refers to an expression of the inner self, and reading can be equated to the “outside life” as the text to be read lies outside to the self and is heterogenous to the self. Sedgwick articulates that “</span><span style="font-weight:400">the most characteristic energies of the Gothic novel</span><span style="font-weight:400">” is rooted in the impossibility of reconciling the “counterparts” of “the inside life and the outside life”(13). However, when the axis of reading and writing is placed in the center of discussing </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, the two seemingly opposing activities of reading and writing indeed “reorganize” themselves into a “communicative” relationship. Then, understanding </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> through the axes of reading and writing and time not only deconstructs the division of the two textual activities and of the past-present-future, but it also reconstructs the categories previously thought to be irreconcilable as in fact interdependent and incessantly haunting and influencing one another. Jodey Castricano conceptualizes writing in </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">Cryptomimesis </span></i><span style="font-weight:400">(2001) as follows: “writing [...] is learning to let the plurivocal spirit speak, a task which is the gothic equivalent of pursuing a phantom through labyrinthine vaults, being led onwards by the echoes of footsteps” (120). However, in </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, it is the reader who learns to speak in such “plurivocal spirit” while the writer deteriorates in his own obsession with authority. And this reader generates meanings like a writer. Reading and writing become a simultaneous process. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>In response to various issues of representation as examined above, the thesis presents a discussion of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400"> in the following structure. The first chapter deals with Jack as a writer, exploring the ways in which writing can be understood in terms of playing<span style="text-decoration:line-through">(1)</span>. Despite some apparent resonances between the two activities as pointed out by both Freud and Barthes, writing and playing can potentially be a dangerously combined attempt when the textual material is the past. To do this, I first focus on the fact that Jack wishes to write a play about his personal past, </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Little School</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. The play-writing is significant because Jack is later possessed by the Overlook and reduced to an agent of the autonomy the hotel exerts over him. In other words, he attempts to play with his own past only to be played by the Overlook’s past. Moving onto the concept of writing as representation, I probe into why Jack is inevitably destroyed in his desire to write, yet avoid framing this destruction simply as a writerly failure. Instead, I identify the locus of Jack’s destruction as his obsession with the futile idea of Author-ity. Authority in this sense is the control an author has over his textual material, the power to authoritatively produce a new narrative. Jack is rejected having this power, because the past, his primary inspiration, is essentially ungraspable and inescapably haunting. Then, Jack’s ‘failure’ is not a personal failure but a failure inherent in writing as a representation. Seàn Burke argues that “[w]hat Roland Barthes has been talking of all along is not the death of the author, but the closure of representation” (48). In the case of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, the author literally dies, because representation cannot happen in the haunted hotel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>The second chapter analyzes Danny as a reader. Danny begins by being a reader who is terrified by the fact that signs can mutate. Due to his shining ability, he witnesses certain signifiers like a perfectly ordinary hotel door can mutate into an unexpected signified that hides a not so ordinary, haunted room inside with a bloated corpse of a lady. He also learns to read in order to please the authoritative writer, who happens to be the authoritative member of his family: his father. However, Danny in the end realizing that the meanings embedded in certain signifiers can indeed shift, and that reading these shifting signifieds is a way to escape the Overlook’s inescapably haunting powers. He becomes capable to read the signifiers and rewrites them according to the meanings required for his survival. In this discussion of Danny, I steer away from understanding him as a child hero. As his middle name repeats the abusive figure of Anthony, who also shares the name with Danny’s future self Tony, Danny inherits a piece of the past in himself regardless of his will. In this sense, he is neither young, nor is he a hero. Yet it is ironic that this seemingly powerless and decentralized character, which embodies a certain undesired past, is telepathic with the future, and has comes to secure a future for himself through his survival. This chapter focuses on how reading-writing and past-present-future are deconstructed. These deconstructions derive from the indistinguishable divisions between the two representational activities and the timeframes. Lastly, this chapter concludes that the future is already haunted by the past, which renders reading-rewriting as a viable means to change the significations of sinister repetition of the past. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400"><i>        </i>The ultimate purpose of this thesis is to show how reading is writing, and how the future is already rooted in the past. The repetition of the past is in fact an omnipresent condition and not a horrifying state. The past has inescapable powers, and the dead is always already alive at the Overlook. I propose to think about the future as a rearrangement of textual signs, or signifiers. It is such rearrangement that allows a construction of the future. As Derrida argues in “Signature Event Context” (1988), every sign can be “put between quotation marks; in so doing it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable” (12) <span style="text-decoration:line-through">##(2)##</span>. The future is none other than the illimitably generated new contexts. This construction is, however, essentially a reconstruction: it is not an “absolutely new” that eschatologically breaks off from the past, but it is cyclical, because haunting is a semiotic condition in which signs are inescapably circulated among themselves. Understanding this repetition of time foremost as a textual phenomenon opens up a mode of rearranging, reconstructing, and reimagining the future: and the prefix ‘re-’ already manifests that the future, as much as the present, is related to the past. The harm of repetition of time is not healed but rehabilitated through reading and writing, by the replacement and displacement of signifiers. It could not, and should not, be healed, but still would be liberating. The ever-repeated presence of the past can be undone and redone through textual activities of reading and writing. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight:400">(Winter 2019)</span></p></div></div></div> <div class="page-index">

If we can, then I want to ask, can the subaltern be represented? Lastly, if language indeed has a performative power, can representation performative reshape the social existence of certain memories and beings? Can literature play a critical role in representing memories that have long been silenced?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">My research centers around the idea of literature "as a strange institution which allows one to say everything" (Jacques Derrida, 1992), </span><span style="font-weight:400">and I read a certain explosive power in the idea that it can say "everything." Literature, to me, is something that stands at the intersection of social urgency and representation. I strive to navigate these axes by which any literary work is constructed, and deconstructed, the most central idea being that there is political power in the act of (un)representation itself. In this, I am always more interested in </span><span style="font-weight:400">what the text </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">does</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, instead of </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">says</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, and how they </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">operate</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">, there than where they </span><i><span style="font-weight:400">stand</span></i><span style="font-weight:400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400">Engaging with memories as a text media, I work to involve literature in historical and sociological sites in order to expand the discipline to render palpable political powers to literature as an act of activism. Literature, as a delicate tool, can narrativize the histories of disappearing communities, archive the stories of underrepresented communities, and circulate these memories to preserve them. Exploring various means and meanings of representation functions as defiance against social erasure, and such exploration not only allows us to access and assess the complex narratives of the forgotten memories, but also to analyze the ways in which these narratives continue to haunt and shape the present. </span></p>

미군들에게 예쁘게 웃어주면서 술을 파는 것이었다는 사실을 나중에 알았다.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;그 때 나는 놀랐다. 말로만 듣던 미군 상대 클럽에서 미군을 상대하는 여성. 그 접대하는 직업과 그 세계가 나한테 이렇게 가까이 들어올 수 있구나. 이게 나랑 이렇게 가깝구나. 어떻게 여태까지 그 세계를 보지 못하고 지냈지. 한국에 있는 미군들의 존재가 이렇게 유령처럼 가깝게 깃들어 있구나. 서울에서 나고 자란 내게, 경기도의 기지촌은 새로운 세계였다. 사장 언니의 말을 이해하고 나서, 나는 위험해진 기분이었다. 그 날 이후 나는 그동안 보지 못했던 것을 보게 되었다. 험프리스 안에서 나를 쳐다보는 카투사 동생들의 깔보는 시선을 보았다. PX에서 일하시는 캐셔 분들의 탐탁치 않아 하는 태도를 보았다. 머리가 짧고 피부색이 어두운 군인이랑 걸어다니던 서울의 거리에서도, 나를 쳐다보는 불편한 눈길들을 느꼈다. 서울의 이름난 대학에서 똑똑하다는 소리를 들으며 공부하며 살았는데, 갑자기 &ldquo;미군을 사귀는 여자애&rdquo; 이름표가 붙고 나의 위치가 달라지는 것을 느꼈다.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;한편으로는 시선을 감내하며 자발적으로 연애를 할 수 있는 나의 특권 또한 깨달았다. 나는 당시에 중소기업에서 번역 일을 하고 있었는데, 업무 특성상 빈 시간이 많았다. 나는 정말 많은 시간을 혼자 기지촌에 대해서 읽으며 보냈다. 놀라운 수치들을 보았고, 충격적인 증언들을 읽었다. 수도 없이 많은 논문을 읽었지만, 긴 시간 잊혀졌거나 지워진 역사였기 때문에 기지촌의 생태를 이해하기가 어려웠다. 글로만 기지촌을 알아가는 것이 답답했다. 회사를 그만두고 두레방에서 자원봉사를 하고 싶다는 생각이 들었다. 진짜로 기지촌의 문제들을 위해서 그리고 그 문제들 속에서 일하는 사람들을 만나고 싶었다. 나는 두레방에 전화를 걸었고, 그렇게 나는 올해의 두레방 데이에 초대받았다.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;다가온 두레방 데이. 나는 가기 전날에 나눠먹을 음식을 만들면서 준비했다. 무엇을 기대해야 할 지 전혀 몰랐기 때문에 긴장도 되고 걱정도 되었다. 실례를 하면 어쩌나, 어떻게 행동해야 하나, 모르겠는 것이 너무 많았다. 일찍 자고, 일찍 일어나서 의정부로 향했다.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;행사의 세팅을 돕고 나서, 옆 골목길에 쭈뼛쭈뼛 서서 담배를 입에 물었다. 그때 내게 들려오는 것은 &ldquo;이리 와서 같이 피워,&rdquo; 하는 언니들의 목소리였다. 행사가 시작하고 나서 또 쭈뼛쭈뼛 음식을 가져와서 이걸 어디서 먹지, 했다. 그때도, &ldquo;이리 와서 같이 먹어요,&rdquo; 필리핀 언니들이 나를 불러줬다. 밥을 먹고, 장터에서 물건을 팔고, 공연들을 보고, 정신 없이 하루가 지나갔다. 그리고 내가 글에서 읽던 슬픔이 넘치던 기지촌의 느낌과 두레방 데이에서 만난 이들은 달랐다. 그 날은 힘이 넘쳤고, 나는 피곤했지만 그만큼 큰 에너지를 받았다. 그래서 두레방에 대한 나의 거침없는 첫인상은 이 세상에 이렇게 멋지고 행복한 장소가 있을까, 하는 것이다. 물론 이곳은 멋진 것 혹은 아름다운 것과는 거리가 멀다. 기지촌의 전성기때부터 일하셨던 언니들, 그리고 지금도 일하고 있는 수많은 이주여성들의 절박함이 있는 곳이다. 착취적인 구조에서 일했고 일하는 사람들, 그 안에서 생기는 빠져나가기 힘든 문제들을 위해 존재하는 곳이 두레방이다. 그러나 두레방 데이에서 내가 가장 강렬하게 볼 수 있었던 것은, 함께 한다는 것의 신나는 기분이었다.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2015년 6월 22일, 나는 아우슈비츠에 갔다. 1940년 6월, 폴란드를 점령한 지 9개월 만에 독일군은 오슈비엥침의 아우슈비츠를 일단 폴란드 정치범을 위한 수용소로 사용하기 시작한다. 1943년 6월, 아우슈비츠 II-비르케나우의 가스실 네 개는 모두 가동 중에 있었다. 내가 아우슈비츠를 간 날은 해가 화창했다. 크라쿠프에 있던 나흘 중 가장 좋았던 날씨. 6월인데 마치 초봄처럼, 잔디밭에 민들레가 잔뜩 있었다. 1940년에도 그랬을까.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;아우슈비츠는 어떤 곳인가. 아우슈비츠는 하나의 장소가 아니다. 비르케나우라고 불리는 제일 큰 수용소인 아우슈비츠 II를 포함해 세 군데가 있다. 우리가 많이 알고 있는 곳은 I과 II. 잘 보존된 아우슈비츠 I에 비해 비르케나우는 대부분 폭발 당했다. 자신들의 악행을 감추려 했던 나치들에 의해. 2차대전 당시에 있던 수용소 중 가장 큰 곳이면서, 유대인 학살의 상징 같기도 한 곳이다. 현재의 추정 상으로는 110만 명이 아우슈비츠에서 살해당했다고 한다. 그 중 90%는 유대인이다. 하지만 그건 추정일 뿐, 정확히 몇 명이 사람이 죽었는지 알기는 아마 불가능할 것이다. 애초에 소련군의 발표에서는 400만 명이 죽었다고 했다. 어차피 죽이려고 데려왔는데, 숫자를 기록해 놓는 건 아무짝에도 쓸모가 없었겠지. 게다가 조금 많이 데리고 왔어야지 말이다. 다만 소련군이 아우슈비츠를 해방시켰을 때, 남자 옷 370,000벌과 여자 옷 837,000개를 찾았다고 한다. 이게 가장 충격적인 부분도 아니다. 소련군은 머리카락도 찾았다. 시체에서, 수감자에서 잘라낸 머리카락은 8.5톤에 달한다. 아우슈비츠에서 가장 &lsquo;활발히&rsquo; 학살을 진행했을 때는 1944년 5월 경이다. 5월 14일, 44만 명의 헝가리계 유대인이 비르케나우에 도착했고 아주 짧은 순간의 선택 과정을 지나 여자, 어린이, 노인 대부분이 가스실로 향했다. &lsquo;샤워를 하러&rsquo;말이다. 아우슈비츠는 사람을 고문하고 가둬두려 이용된 장소가 아니다. 아우슈비츠는 가장 효율적이고 조용하게 사람을 죽이려 이용된 장소이다. 헝가리에서 유대인이 쏟아져 들어오자 가스실과 더 가깝게 도착하도록 기찻길을 연장해서 놓았을 정도이다. 정말로, 아우슈비츠의 잔인성을 이해하기란 불가능하다.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;나는 아우슈비츠에 가기 전날 예약을 취소할까 진지하게 고민했다. 부다페스트에서 공산주의 시절 썼던 지하 감옥 같은 곳엘 갔는데 그때 들어가자마자 숨이 막히고 저절로 눈물이 나올 정도로 너무 무서워서 경비 할아버지 손을 잡고 나 제발 밖에 데려다 달라고 애원했던 적이 있다. 내가 어릴 때 다녔던 유치원은 잠시 정신이 나갔었는지 여섯 살짜리 꼬마들을 데리고 서대문형무소로 소풍을 가서 밀랍인형들이 고문당하는 장면을 보여줬었다. 한 한 달 동안 잠을 못 잤던 기억이 난다. 하여튼 이런저런 끔찍한 기억들이 나서, 어쩌면 가봤자 들어가지도 못하고 버스에 한 여섯 시간 동안 혼자 앉아있게 될까 봐 예약을 취소하려 했다. 그래도 크라쿠프까지 왔으니까&hellip; 여기 와서 한 게 피에로기 (폴란드식 만두인데 호스텔 근처에 예쁜 언니들이 일하는 귀여운 피에로기 식당이 있어서 매일 3번씩 갔다. 싸기도 엄청나게 쌌다. 만두 한 접시에 6천 원쯤 했나) 먹기밖에 없으니까&hellip; 가야겠다 싶었다. 그래서 마음을 먹었고, 다음 날 아침 여섯 시쯤 일어나서 아우슈비츠로 가는 버스에 올랐다.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;아트 슈피겔만의 &lsquo;쥐&rsquo;는 자신의 아버지 블라덱이 겪은 2차대전을 그려낸 2권짜리 만화책이다. 슈피겔만의 부모님은 두 분 다 폴란드계 유대인으로, 아우슈비츠를 살아남은 생존자들이다. 슈피겔만은 전쟁 후 스웨덴에서 태어나 미국에서 자랐다. 1978년에 아버지의 이야기를 녹음하기 시작해 만화가 완결되어 책으로 출판된 것은 1991년이니 13년에 걸쳐 작업한 대작이라고 할 수 있겠다. 그렇게 오래 걸린 이유는, 음. 중간에 아버지가 돌아가셨고. 슈피겔만 스스로 어떤 수식어도 부족할 만큼 복잡하고 잔혹한 홀로코스트라는 범죄를 요약하고 축소해 만화로 그린다는 것에 대해 죄책감을 느꼈던 것 같다. 만화라는 플랫폼에 홀로코스트를 올려놓는다는 것이 정당한지, 아니 어떤 플랫폼에라도 홀로코스트를 올려놓는 것이 정당한지 엄청나게나게 고민하는 흔적이 많이 보인다. 아버지의 이야기에서 가장 본질적인 것을 찾아 만화를 만들어내는 과정에서 느꼈을 법한 슈피겔만의 고통이 매 페이지에 보인다. 그러나 정말 완벽한 책이다. 엄청나게 인간적인 책이다. 또, 남겨진 이야기들, 보이지 않는 이야기들, 그릴 수 없는 이야기들이 모두 다 들리는 듯할 만큼 완벽하게 짜인 만화다.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;이건 정말 많은 것들에 관한 이야기다. 일단은 당연히, 홀로코스트를 살아남은 한 남자에 관한 이야기다. 그러나 자신의 독단적이고 고집불통인 아버지를 이해해보려는 아들의 이야기이면서도, 초인적인 의지와 서로에 대한 사랑으로 아우슈비츠를 살아남은 한 부부에 관한 이야기이기도 하다.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;쥐&rsquo;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;내 아우슈비츠 경험은 어땠는지. 내가 걱정했던 것과는 정반대로, 아우슈비츠는 전혀 무섭지 않았다. 단지, 산처럼 쌓여있는 슈트케이스 더미를 보니까 마음이 아팠다. 아프고 이상했다. 남의 것과 헷갈리지 않으려고 이름도 쓰여 있던 슈트케이스들. 전혀 쓸모도 없었을 짐을 바리바리 싸왔을 유대인 엄마들. 이동 당하기 전, 그 가방을 챙기는 가족의 모습을 상상하고, 그들의 기분을 상상했다. 그 가방의 주인들은 대부분 가스실에서 죽었을 것이다.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;아우슈비츠 I과 비르케나우에 갔었는데 두 군데 다 정말 어마어마하게 컸다. 아우슈비츠 I은 거의 낮은 아파트 단지처럼 생겼고, 비르케나우는 폭발 당했기 때문에 황량한 들판에 굴뚝만 수백 개가 솟아 있다. 그런데 정말 하나도 무섭지 않았다. 왜냐하면, 부다페스트의 지하 감옥이나 서대문형무소와는 달리, 아우슈비츠는 사람을 괴롭히려 만들어진 곳이 아니기 때문이다. 아우슈비츠는 그냥 최대한 많은 사람을 최대한 싸고 빠르게 죽이기 위해 설계된 공간이었다. 그리고 그 엄청난 크기 때문에, 진짜 정말 엄청나게 크기 때문에, 건물에 들어가지 않는다면 거의 쾌적한 느낌까지 들고, 그런 차원의 학살이 있었다는 걸 상상조차 할 수 없어진다. 그니까 그 &lsquo;하나도 무섭지 않게 하는 이유&rsquo;가 사실은 아우슈비츠를 가장 끔찍하게 하는 이유인 것이다.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;도대체 어떻게 그런 일이 가능할 수 있었을까.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;정말로 무서운 것은 그 장소 자체가 아니었다. 정말로 무서운 것은 그 장소에서 수백만 명이 질식해서, 총 맞아서, 굶어서, 추워서, 아파서 죽었다는 사실도 아니고, 거의 똥통에서 생활하며 이유 없이 구타당하고 그들이 인간이라는 사실을 부정당했다는 사실도 아니다. 정말로 무서운 것은, 아우슈비츠에서 일하던 수십 명의 나치 친위대가 매일 출근하고 퇴근했다는 사실이다. 홀로코스트라는 죽이는 사업에 종사했던 그들은, 그들도 아버지였으며, 남편이었고, 유대인을 가스실에 몰아넣는 작업이 끝나고 저녁이 되면 동네 맥주집에서 친구들과 술잔을 기울이는 아저씨였다는 사실이다. 정말로. 특별히 더 악마 같아서 그런 직업을 갖게 된 것이 아니란 말이다.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;고양이가 쥐를 잡아먹는 것은 당연하지만, 나치가 유대인을 잡아먹는 것은 당연하지 않다. 한 정부가 하나의 민족을 세상에서 삭제시키려고 했던 일은 정말 무시무시한 것이지만, 그 당시에는 마치 고양이가 쥐를 잡아먹듯이 당연히 여겨졌다. 이스라엘에 가서 아이히만의 재판을 보기 전에도 알 수 있다. 아렌트의 말처럼 명백한 &lsquo;무사유의 죄&rsquo;인데, 그렇게 말해버리고 나니 어깨와 목 사이 어딘가가 가려운 것 같다. 찜찜하다. &lsquo;집단적인, 그리고 조직화된 광기가 인류를 어떻게 몰아가는지 보여준다&rsquo;라고 말해버리기엔, 너무나도, 너무나도 부족하다.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;난 아마 어떻게 그런 일이 일어날 수 있었는지 절대 이해하지 못할 것이다.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;블라덱의 이야기는 전쟁으로부터가 아니라 슈피겔만의 어머니를 만나고 사랑에 빠지던 때로부터 시작한다. &lsquo;쥐&rsquo;의 이야기는 폴란드에서가 아니라 미국에서 끝난다. 홀로코스트 전에도, 그 후에도, 삶은 있었다. 삶은 있어야 했다.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;

Etymologically rooted in the Greek &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ἔ&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;ellipsis&rdquo; signifies meanings such as &ldquo;falling short&rdquo; and &ldquo;leave out&rdquo;. (&ldquo;Ellipsis&rdquo;) The ellipsis thereby becomes a signifier embodying what fell short and left out. It makes what has been only articulated by silence in between spoken or written words. Silence, however, is none other than absence of sounds. Yet the ellipsis marks the silence, nothingness, in a visible written form. The three dots across the page marks a presence of the absence, signifying the things left unsaid yet nonetheless there, occupying a place on the paper. It is such spectral presence of the ellipsed that enable a silent yet existent voice of the subaltern in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">an intimate account of what the Soviets called &ldquo;Great Patriotic War&rdquo;. The text is almost entirely composed by interviews Alexievich conducted, which she then transcribes into written text and combines with her personal writings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within this heteroglossic text, Alexievich inserts her authorial mark in the transcriptions, as signified through her abundant use of ellipses to mark profound silences. In between each tercet of dots, the ellipsis becomes implicative, and can be read as sonorous with absent voices; Alexievich opens up extra-linguistic space into which these long-silent others can enter and be heard.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a both groundbreaking and strange text</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;it is groundbreaking in that Alexievich unravels the narratives of women veterans that have long been erased from the official discourses of the war, and strange, because it stands at the narrow threshold between an objective reportage and an extremely private literary piece. It is also an epic-scale work that took over a decade to complete. Alexievich beings her job during when Soviet Union, travelling all around the USSR to meet and interview women veterans, the first version being published in 1985, then republished in 2004. She repetitively presents one after another of traumatized memories women veterans who fought and participated at various positions during the WWII, telling stories of the war that have never been related before. She conducts thousands of interviews. While she justifies her selective process as an attempt &ldquo;to try to record women of various military professions,&rdquo; it is ironic that she only records those who fought in defense of the USSR. To specify, she does not record the stories of, for example, wartime prostitutes, or those who betrayed Soviet ideology. The most tragic narratives of those who had the illusion of Soviet greatness are prioritized. Indeed, Alexievich could not record all the stories in total, and such totality would be against the polyphony this work captures. Yet it does seem like yet another subaltern silencing. This paper locates the &ldquo;left out&rdquo; in the signifier of the ellipsis. Alexievich acknowledges always-another possibility of other voices coming in, through the ellipsis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous criticisms on this text have focused on the issues of Alexievich&rsquo;s authorship and victimization of the interviewed women. The unconventional genre of the work being not entirely any of the &ldquo;collected novel,&rdquo; &ldquo;novel-oration,&rdquo; &ldquo;novel-testimony,&rdquo; &ldquo;epic-chorus,&rdquo; (Jaireth 90) have drawn serious interests regarding the mode of organization Alexievich takes upon with various writings. For example, in her article &ldquo;Through the Eyes of a Humanist,&rdquo; Subhash Jaireth states that Alexievich &ldquo;curat[es] the narratives,&rdquo; yet &ldquo;does not force meaning&rdquo;. He further goes on to argue that a &ldquo;remarkable feature of Alexievich&rsquo;s books is the absence of authorial commentary&rdquo; (91). Then, Jaireth, critiquing and praising something that is not in the text itself, makes an impossible claim. While it is reasonable that Alexievich rather functions as a curator than an author to her work, the absence of authorial hand does not seem like a possible state to achieve. However subtly, she excludes certain narratives and includes some others. In this activity, an authorial commentary cannot be absolutely absent, and the process of transcription can never be completely transparent. On the other hand, Dana Bizuleanu reads a number of Alexievich&rsquo;s works in a post-humanist perspective. Regarding </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bizuleanu argues, &ldquo;the women in Alexievich&rsquo;s books are the plural, nomadic subject, in which any life/death dichotomies cease to exist&rdquo; (284). The basis for this argument, which seems to be an extreme leap, is that the absence of menstruation in the female bodies on the battlegrounds manifests the &ldquo;material and physical outcome on war,&rdquo; turning them to such posthuman subjects. Furthermore, the life/death dichotomy never comes to an end. Life is desired and death is feared in the text, and this dichotomy of desire and fear remains consistent. Aliaksandr Novikau, lastly, takes on an essentialist perspective on &ldquo;women&rsquo;s true, authentic narratives&rdquo; (320). His argument not only reduces femininity into true authenticity, he also invests in a naive argument: &ldquo;Alexievich looks for such a person [...] assaulted, humiliated, and offended by the totalitarian state, but was able to win at the end of the day&rdquo; (324). His vague conception of &lsquo;winning&rsquo; has no relevance to Alexievich&rsquo;s project in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it is exactly such logic of power relations of winning and losing that she attempts at subverting. Without investigating into the quiet authorial mark of the ellipses and attempting to listen the very persistent yet again quiet voice of the subaltern, these criticisms remain very limited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of such criticisms, this paper focuses on Alexievich&rsquo;s deliberate and political use of the ellipses, framing that ghostly syntax as a marker of the presence of the absent. The silence, as non-sound, does not have to be marked in the realm of the present. Yet Alexievich marks this non-sound through the visible signifier, &ldquo;...&rdquo;. Furthermore, the ellipsis, used together by Alexievich and the women veterans, signals at a sense of collectivity. Attempting to capture a voice of the subaltern, Alexievich assembles the women into a chorus in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They are once again in a struggle together, to represent their unrepresentable selves and experiences. Going against Susan Sontag&rsquo;s argument on the always-already ideologically stipulated nature of the collective memory, this paper brings Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak into the conversation to rethink the potential of subaltern&rsquo;s voice actually being heard, and having significance. The veterans who speak in this text are not only marginalized by global capitalism by being a Soviet, but also by the domestic and nationalistic sexism, by being a woman. In this doubly marginalized space, these women are silenced by the male-centered and patriotic discourses of war and struggle to make sense of how their dehumanizing experience of violence at various battlegrounds could have been glorified and reduced in the name of victory. These silenced women face an epistemic violence similar to that the women Spivak discusses in &ldquo;Can the Subaltern Talk?&rdquo;. These women struggle to speak yet cannot; and in Alexievich&rsquo;s carefully selective process, some narratives are excluded and some are prioritized over another. This paper locates the space where these uncontained women&rsquo;s voice at the three dots of the ellipsis. The ellipsis, then, is a political strategy: it acknowledges the unrepresentable experiences of the subaltern and functions as a eulogy to those who have been rendered voiceless.</span></p>'},{__typename:a},{__typename:n},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subaltern speaks in quiet polyphony across </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, their narratives flowing out of the textual space. When Spivak asks the question, &ldquo;Can the subaltern speak?&rdquo;, her answer is set; it is no, they cannot, at least for themselves. The subaltern as the colonized female subject face layers of exploitation and marginalization: by their gender, class, ethnicity, nationality, and more. Situated in that very narrow margin, no existing discourse can articulate or represent the exploitation and position of these subaltern women. Spivak&rsquo;s main point of critique is the seeming ignorance of their position as Western subjects in Foucault-Deleuze theorization of non-representation as liberation. She says, &ldquo;The subject of exploitation cannot know and speak the text of female exploitation even if the absurdity of the nonrepresenting intellectual making space for her to speak is achieved. The woman is doubly in the shadow&rdquo; (84). The French post-structuralists, focusing on the inherent violence embedded on the theory of representation, identifies such theory as the theory of the Subject, handing him the epistemic power to objectify (as opposed to subject) and thus re-present beings. They subvert this theory of representation, then let the subaltern speak for themselves: a freedom from objectifying representations. Yet Spivak views this only a deepening of the epistemic violence that the subaltern already goes through, making such non-representation theory only an illusory liberation. She asserts that, in Foucault-Deleuze conception of nonrepresentation, &ldquo;two senses of representation are being run together: representation as &lsquo;speaking for&rsquo;, as in politics, and representation as re-presentation, as in art or philosophy&rdquo; (70). Spivak calls for the representation as &lsquo;speaking for,&rsquo; the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetreten</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, within the &ldquo;state and political economy&rdquo; (70). Such </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetreten</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is critical because the subaltern must be politically represented from that position of exploitation and marginalization that utterly silence them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The positionality of these female veterans has to be taken under scrutiny. The subaltern group is always heterogeneous. Then, regardless of how polyphonic this text is, it would be too utopian to read </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a transparent representation of the subaltern embodying all the voice: indeed, such an understanding of the polyphony within this text would once again subsume the subaltern under totality. It also has to be addressed that there is an irreducible difference between the positionality of those woman that Spivak discusses and those Alexievich records. Soviet woman veterans are not colonized subjects. Furthermore, in that they fought the war wearing the uniform of Soviet Union, they are nonetheless participants of Stalinist ideology. On the one hand, this would illustrate them a collaborator of the very regime that had them under a complete and frightful oppression for decades. That is undeniably true. On the other, it is important to note that their narrative has been systematically undermined and erased. One censor states, &ldquo;[Alexievich&rsquo;s work] is a lie! This is slander against our soldiers&rdquo; (xxxv).</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A husband, and a fellow veteran, of a woman Alexievich interviews tells his wife: &ldquo;Tell it the way I taught you. Without tears and women&rsquo;s trifles: how you wanted to be beautiful, how you wept when they cut off your braid&rdquo; (xxii). Such a remark clearly manifests the gendered nature in the undermining of these women&rsquo;s stories. Lastly, a co-worker of one of these veterans regards her narrative as merely &ldquo;women&rsquo;s fantasies&rdquo; (xxii). The women weep, but their stories are not trifles, and never fantasized. They weep, lamenting of their youth lost somewhere on the battlefields. They are situated at an awkward place between being a human and being an instrument of the Soviet, Stalinist, and Nationalist ideology. While they are not colonized individuals, the ways in which they are summoned to support hegemonic, masculine ideology resemble and resonate with the treatment of Hindu women as objects to be either protected or systematically silenced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The double shadow that puts these women&rsquo;s narratives in the darkness is created between two pairs of contradictions: collectivity versus individual pain, and Soviet masculine hero versus feminine victimhood. These four elements are surely interconnected. Contextualizing such contradictions finally illuminate the shadowed space. Catherine Merridale, in her essay &ldquo;Trauma and Shell-shock in Twentieth-century Russia,&rdquo; asserts that tragedy in Soviet history has been systematically prohibited. She says,</span></p>'},{__typename:c},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In another article, Merridale asserts, &ldquo;many of the worst disasters of the Soviet era were officially ignored or even denied&rdquo; (2). Both are self-evident statements. The latter shows the selective process of history-making and glorifying. The former, manifesting the Soviet conception of individual trauma as &ldquo;egocentrism,&rdquo; a crime against the collective victory, also puts emphasis on the toughness of Soviet mentality compared to &ldquo;their counterparts from the capitalist west&rdquo; (47). Such an emphasis, and the word &ldquo;muscular,&rdquo; connotes the propagandistic attitude that regards victimhood as essentially weak, perhaps feminine. They also silenced themselves: as, one cannot really talk about the tragedies of an event that did not really happen. Thinking of the devaluation of the women&rsquo;s narrative discussed previously, within this historical context, demonstrates what Spivak means when she says, &ldquo;between patriarchy and imperialism, subject-constitution and object-formation, the figure of the woman disappears, not into a pristine nothingness, but into a violent shuttling&rdquo; (102). If the &ldquo;imperialism&rdquo; can be understood as Stalinism in this context, the double shadow that darkens the women&rsquo;s stories come to take upon shape. First, it is the nationalism that deny tragedy altogether and only leaves glory. Second, it is the sexism that puts the tragic sense in the realm of the feminine and thus pathetic. This is in part embodied in the text through Alexievich&rsquo;s own words as well. She says, &ldquo;&lsquo;women&rsquo;s&rsquo; war had its own colors, its own smells, its own lighting, and its own range of feelings. Its own words&rdquo; (xiv). Even Alexievich renders &ldquo;women&rsquo;s war&rdquo; as fundamentally different to that of man&rsquo;s, thereby assuming an essential femininity, in an effort to understand her text as something different to those of canonized history. Perhaps, in this sense, the analogy of &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; is inappropriate: the Stalinism and sexism operate as apparatuses that bring palpable destructions to these women&rsquo;s experiences as veterans. One woman says, &ldquo;The war ended&hellip; We looked at each other and didn&rsquo;t believe that the war had ended and we were still alive. Now we were going to live&hellip; We were going to love&hellip; But we had forgotten all that, we didn&rsquo;t know how to do it&rdquo; (240). Articulating the position of these female subaltern without an intervention of oppressive hegemonic ideology becomes extremely complicated, consigning them in the realm of unspeakability.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unspeakable in the context of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implies the experiences troubled to an extreme that makes it impossible to articulate. The word itself signifies an impossibility of speaking like the subaltern. In this sense, the word unspeakability is placed on two levels: on the level of the subaltern self, and the level of unspeakable war experiences. In response to Pierre Machery&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;What is important in a work is what it does not say,&rdquo; regarding the interpretation of ideology, Spivak argues, &ldquo;when we come to the [...] question of the consciousness of the subaltern, the notion of what the work </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say becomes important&rdquo; (82). &ldquo;Cannot&rdquo; quite literally point to the inability of the speaking from the subaltern&rsquo;s position: no discourse can fully embody the multi-layered marginalization of the subaltern, and they themselves cannot fully know the circumstances of their marginalization. This is significant, because the ellipsis, as a place where what fell short is demarcated, is fundamentally related to the stories that could not have been said. Such rethinking of the elliptic articulation then paradoxically illuminates the ellipsed as a place abundant with voices, not at all absent, as visibly marked on the paper as a sequence of dots. This resonates with Jacque Derrida&rsquo;s identification of the absence as in fact primary, also quoted by Spivak. It is related, &ldquo;&lsquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">thought</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is&hellip; the blank part of the text&rsquo; (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">OG</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 93)<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">##(1)##</span>&nbsp;that which is thought is, if blank, still </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the text </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and must be consigned to the Other of history&rdquo; (89). The Other in this context becomes none other than the subaltern. The implicative silence is undeniably there, as a place as where the subaltern speaks. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then, can and should be read as an attempt to embody the speech of the subaltern, in that Alexievich opens up that very realm of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetreten</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through elliptic articulation.</span></p>'},{__typename:a},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subaltern struggles collectively against the unspeakable. The concomitant issue, then, becomes what it is that is exactly embodied by such marker of the absence. The ellipticity in the work is manifested by two functions. First, there is elliptic articulation. Second, there is elliptic collectivity. Such collectivity is also critical considering its particular connotations of Stalinism. Yet the ellipsis is not just a hollow place that contains what the text cannot possibly speak. It has another very specific function, and that is the role of ellipsis as signaling a collectivity. While the signifier &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; has been inserted by Alexievich herself in the process of transcription, the silence and the sense of unfinalizability being signified here are shared among all participants in this text. Nevertheless, such elliptic collectivity is twofold. One fold is occupied by the subversive potential of collectivity, as opposed to capitalist individualism. Merridale points out the overarching nostalgia the Soviet people has for this sense of &ldquo;collective solidarity, the idea of common comfort, and the overwhelming generosity&rdquo; are &ldquo;the things more frequently mourned by Russians&rdquo; (55). Spivak also understands the impossibility of the collective as one locus of the oppression. She says, &ldquo;The impossibility of collectivity itself is persistently foreclosed through the manipulation of female agency&rdquo; (78). Indeed, writing in critique of global capitalism from a Marxist standpoint, Spivak values the importance of such collective. Yet it is none other than this Marxist emphasis on the collective that creates the &ldquo;Stalinist collective,&rdquo; &ldquo;which is intolerant of invalidity, and repelled by psychiatric damage&rdquo; (Merridale 55). Again, it is none other than this collectivity that is made into totality, sublating the women&rsquo;s narrative. Then, how to rethink this tricky matter of collectivity becomes critical. Departing from the contradictions between collective solidarity and individualism enriches the understanding of the elliptic collectivity as a struggle for the unspeakable. Then, the space of this type of collective is created on their own by the women veterans and Alexievich herself in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: for the inevitable struggle to represent and to speak the unspeakable experiences, and to acknowledge the looming presence of the unspoken, together.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such elliptic collectivity is subtly implied in the opening and closing of the work. The text opens and closes with sentences ending with an ellipsis, the former being part of Alexievich&rsquo;s own writing and the latter part of a veteran&rsquo;s account. The significance of this continuity is more thoroughly highlighted considering a statement from one of the letters Alexievich receives. It says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of us, you&rsquo;re a frontline girl too&rdquo; (71). Few pages later, looking at a photograph of a young couple during the wartime, Alexievich relates, &ldquo;The time between us disappears&rdquo; (98). There exists an unmistakable social and temporal difference between them: one a war veteran and the other a writer, one who grew up during the height of Soviet spirit and the other during its decline. Despite this vast gap, the anonymous woman thinks of Alexievich as part of the collective struggle that the former &ldquo;frontline girls&rdquo; go though; and Alexievich understand that there really has not been much change between their times. The war is not over: &ldquo;The war hasn&rsquo;t ended and never will&rdquo; (77). The haunting effects of the war will always be present. Yet the &ldquo;war&rdquo; here does not seem to be limited as the historical event itself. The significance embedded in this elliptic collectivity goes beyond the level of conflict with ideological forces that put them at the front against Nazism or at the front against national censorship. It is the struggle to comprehend their painful and denied memories, and to utter their erased and troubled memories. Ellipsis used together by the women veterans and Alexievich, an elliptic collectivity is created: together in the struggle to speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of collectivity is closely related with the idea of collective memory. Alexievich opens up a space for the women veterans&rsquo; memory to be embodied collectively in the epic that is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unwomanly Face of War</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating an explosive collection of memories. The elliptic collectivity explores the potentials of collective effort in representation. In this, it comes to stand in opposition to how Susan Sontag concludes collective memory in her work, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding the Pain of Others </span></i><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">##(2)##</span></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undermining all possibility of the collective, Sontag argues,</span></p>'},{__typename:c},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this line of argument is followed, the collective memory is always manipulated by hegemonic ideology of the Subject. While Alexievich shows traces of female essentialization and victimization, which can be said to be shaped by hegemonic gender constructions, what her empirical interviews and her use of ellipsis shows is quite different. Collectivity can be stipulated, yet the sense of togetherness in their struggle to speak of their experiences from their positions cannot be denied in this narrative. It is this collective struggle that dominate both the memories and this work embodying such memories. Concluding that collective memory is always that malleable would be to assume an utter passivity of each individual memory holder. In Sontag&rsquo;s frame, then, the subaltern can never be represented, as the representative images will always be instruments of ideology. Yet the subaltern can and should be represented, and that is also the &ldquo;circumscribed task&rdquo; of a female intellectual as an intellectual (Spivak 104).</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ways in which these women ceases being thought merely as instruments and are shown to be as actual human beings can be located in elliptic articulation. The inexpressible embodied by the ellipsis is both a manifestation of a pragmatic frustration and a profound irreducibility of human beings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The frustration felt when confronted with their own attempt to represent their own experiences, frustrated precisely because they are stunned at how inexpressible their troubled memories of the war are, is not only embodied in the ellipses but directly spoken about and stressed over in a multiple of narratives. Anna Petrovna sergeant and a medical assistant says, &ldquo;The words are somewhere&hellip; We need a poet&hellip; Like Dante&rdquo; (207). Another veteran says, &ldquo;I am afraid of words. Words are scary...&rdquo; (xxxvii). And lastly, a question by Valentina Petrovna: &ldquo;I want to find words&hellip; How can I express it all?&rdquo; Alexievich composes the chorus of endeavoring women, trying to &ldquo;express it all,&rdquo; into a work of an epic-scale like that of Dante. It seems that Petrovna&rsquo;s question clearly captures all these struggles of words and representation, epitomizing the issue that lies at the heart of this text: the insufficiency of words at expressing the inexpressible, and the encompassing ellipsis that connects here two phrases, containing what the words cannot. Words are scary specifically because its insufficiency as when they are uttered and written down, whatever is spoken becomes anchored when there is always so much more. As Alexievich says, the small overrides: &ldquo;For me one human being is so much. There is everything in him</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;you can get lost</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (141). It is in this sense that the &ldquo;Human being is greater than the war&rdquo; (xvii). A human, when attempted to be instrumentalized, will always be frustrated and pained over their dehumanization, the failure of Soviet totalitarianism being one example. On the other hand, a war is malleable and reducible, easily turned into an instrument of numbing propaganda. In other words, there is no ellipsis in a war in a discourse charged with political ideology. In a human being, there is always a space left open for an ellipsis.</span></p>'},{__typename:n},{__typename:a},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ellipsis then, is a liberating failure. Alexievich writes, &ldquo;a full stop immediately turns into an ellipsis&hellip;&rdquo; (xxvii). A full stop is used to signify an end of a sentence. In a sentence closed with a period, the intended words have all been transcribed and the meaning is contained within itself by that fully stopped sentence. Whatever that is supposed to be conveyed, have been conveyed. An ellipsis, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. It signifies a failure at achieving all of the above that a full stop can. The sentence could not have been finished. Within an ellipsis, there looms the uncontainable significations and unstoppable overflow of stories. In other words, it manifests that there is &ldquo;something [...] impossible to convey&rdquo; (211). Then the significance of the work&rsquo;s strangely simple opening and closing phrases come to be illuminated differently. The work is opened by &ldquo;I am writing a book about war&hellip;&rdquo; (xi), the sentence unfinished for that the implication of none of the elements in that sentence can be demarcated and defined. Who is the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; when the work is overtly polyphonic; what is the &ldquo;writing,&rdquo; when Alexievich records and transcribes the interviews; what is the &ldquo;book,&rdquo; when the stories boundlessly overflow between dots across the page, blurring the limits of where the book stops; and what is the &ldquo;war,&rdquo; when there is always &ldquo;yet another war&rdquo; (139) to be unraveled as each woman starts speaking? These questions are made valid through the use of ellipses, raising up the anchor of meaning and liberating them. The Unwomanly Face of War thus opens up a different dimension of speaking though the ellipses. Silence becomes sonorous and ellipsis becomes populous with significations. Perhaps one may argue that the vetreten of the subaltern in between each tercet of dots is yet another non-representation, the subaltern speaking only though the ellipsed, thereby once again following the Foucault-Deleuze line of thinking. Yet it cannot be disregarded that the spoken narrative overflows in the textual space of The Unwomanly Face of War&mdash;and the abundance of ellipsis signals at the unspeakable even among the most painful to relate. Perhaps one may argue that such elliptic articulation is powerless. Yet disregarding the struggle to speak within their voicelessness and to imagine a different collectivity within that struggle would once again undermine their effort to speak, to speak against the epistemic violence that not only render them voiceless, but also make a voice an impossibility to them. Ellipsis is not a non-existence. Powerless in its silence it may be, yet it is nonetheless powerful because clearly marked. Stories flow out of the dots&mdash;questioning the finalized and officialized discourses of the vent that not only destroyed their youth but also rendered them fundamentally voiceless. Yet there is more meaning in their silences than the screaming terms like the &ldquo;Great Patriotic War&rdquo;. The silences, marked visibly, contain the uncontainable and speak the unspeakable.</p><p>(Summer 2018)</p>'},{__typename:n}],seo:{description:"The Presence of Absent Narratives in Svetlana Alexievich’s The Unwomanly Face of War",image:{alt:e,url:Rs,responsiveImage:{bgColor:"#bcbcbc",aspectRatio:1.4385026737967914,height:187,sizes:"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px",src:Rs,webpSrcSet:"https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 67w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 134w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 201w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg?fm=webp 269w",srcSet:"https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg?dpr=0.25 67w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg?dpr=0.5 134w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg?dpr=0.75 201w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg 269w",width:269,alt:e,base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",title:e}},title:Ms}},{slug:"stand-me-now-ever-in-good-steed",title:"On Therapeutic Intertextuality",id:"4176515",headlineTitle:zs,isKrHeadline:t,subtitle:"<p>Intertextuality, Trauma, and Labyrinth in Alison Bechdel&rsquo;s <em>Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic</em></p>",isKrSubtitle:t,scrapText:'"Old Father, Old Artificer, Stand me Now and Ever In Good Stead"\n',isKrScrap:t,scrapImage:{alt:e,url:u,responsiveImage:{bgColor:we,aspectRatio:me,height:477,sizes:fe,src:u,webpSrcSet:ye,srcSet:Ae,width:743,alt:e,base64:be,title:e}},sections:[{__typename:a},{__typename:n},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alison Bechdel&rsquo;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graphic narrative </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (2006) is a book about three things. On one level, the work is a memoir recounting Bechdel&rsquo;s relationship with her closeted gay father, herself being a lesbian. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is then fundamentally within the genre of queer autobiography, exploring the identities of those sexually queer. On another, because this text circles around Bruce&rsquo;s (supposed) suicide and the shocking revelations of his sexuality, this work is also about Bechdel&rsquo;s traumatic encounter with the events leading up to and following his death. Lastly, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a narrative of Bechdel constructing her own artistic identity, paralleled with yet also overcoming her own &ldquo;old father, old artificer&rdquo; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">##(1)##</span>: Bruce Bechdel. Quoting James Joyce&rsquo;s closing words in his modernist bildungsroman, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at the opening of her own narrative, Bechdel actively engages with and reverses canonical literature in representing her own traumatized memoir.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While trauma, intertextuality, and artist-becoming all serve as dominant elements in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, previous criticisms fall short in understanding the intricate relationship in which the three elements are entangled in the way of Alison searching to escape from the metaphorical labyrinth that is the trauma inflicted by Bruce&rsquo;s death. On the one hand, there is a group of critics that read the work in terms of an archive, focusing on its significance regarding queer narrative genealogy. Ann Cvetkovich, notably, argues that &ldquo;standing at the intersections of both contemporary LGBTQ culture and public discussions of historical trauma, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dares to claim historical significance and public space&rdquo; (112). On the other hand, critics like Julia Watson reads the work in focus to its autobiographical form, arguing that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s hybrid mode as an autobiography &ldquo;[explores] complex formations of gender and sexuality in the modern family&rdquo; (28).&nbsp; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a representative text of queer graphic memoir is inarguably important. However, by emphasizing the issue of sexuality, both frames of criticism mainly highlight the autobiographical and historical aspects of the work and undermines the textual significance the work holds internally.&nbsp;</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun Home </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a text representing a trauma is agreed upon by critics. Yet what remains widely unacknowledged is Bechdel&rsquo;s intertextual mode of representing the trauma. The critical discussion over the work&rsquo;s apparent intertextuality centers around the relationship between literary modernism as a highbrow culture and graphic narrative as a pop culture. For example, Ariela Freedman understands Bechdel&rsquo;s ample citation of Joyce, Fitzgerald and Proust as an invitation for the reader &ldquo;to read her book alongside theirs and making a space for herself on the shelf of modernist literature&rdquo; (126), and further asserts that &ldquo;Bechdel is clearly stating the legitimacy of the graphic narrative as inheritor of the modernist tradition, particularly as exemplified through Joyce&rdquo; (130). Such argument is not free from hierarchical thinking that divides what is truly literary and what is not, and Freedman ironically seems to think that there are texts that are &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;. If such hierarchical thinking can be abandoned altogether, then there is no need for such an invitation nor claim for legitimacy. Indeed, as Jane Tolmie argues, &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s negotiations of a modernist canon [troubles] our reliance on categories of high and low, included and excluded, straight and queer, textual and embodied&rdquo; (79). Intertextuality in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a significance that goes beyond mere stylistics or generic divisions between different literary categories; yet much of critical discussion does not think of intertextuality otherwise.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 2006 interview with Hillary Chute, Bechdel states that &ldquo;I realized that the book was sort of organizing itself around different books or authors&rdquo; (1005). Such statement points out that the intertextual representation in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was an organic and natural. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a text about traumatic experience, it is critical to understand how such an unrepresentable event came to be represented with abundant textual references</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The significance of this issue becomes even more evident considering the odd relationship trauma has with representationality. In the case of Bechdel, the trauma in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is unrepresentable on many levels. The shocking revelations of Bruce&rsquo;s sexual attraction to younger boys never fully come into light because it has been indirectly revealed through a photograph and through her mother&rsquo;s words. Furthermore, his death as a suicide is also only speculated and thus remains unconfirmable. In this situation, the various texts Bechdel holds become the only evidence to the &ldquo;detective work&rdquo; (1006) she tries to conduct in order to pin down the person that Bruce was, and what was so traumatic about her relationship with her father. Nonetheless, as Tolmie argues, a trauma is &ldquo;a representational limit&rdquo; (86), in that a traumatic experience &ldquo;shatters all potential frames of comprehension and reference&rdquo; (Guerin and Hallas 3). Yet the genre of graphic narrative, in Chute&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;puts pressure on dominant conceptions of trauma&rsquo;s unrepresentability&rdquo; (182)<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">##(2)##</span>.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This overtly visual and, in the case of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, intertextual narrative indeed poses a question regarding trauma&rsquo;s representability, complicating the understanding that trauma is incomprehensible and thus representable.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This paper, then, discusses the intertextual mode of representing the trauma, specifically in terms of Joycean presence throughout the text, focusing on the Daedalus-Icarus myth. In his paper, &ldquo;&ldquo;A Vast &lsquo;Network of Transversals&rsquo;&rsquo;: Labyrinthine Aesthetics in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;, K.W. Eveleth pays attention to the labyrinth as the central stylistic feature of this narrative. Arguing that the labyrinthine structure of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to emphasize the &ldquo;masochistic repetition of Derridean &ldquo;archive fever&rdquo;&rdquo; (89). Such stylistic resemblances between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a labyrinth are significant, and also have been made clear by Bechdel herself (Chute 183). Yet, while Eveleth&rsquo;s analysis of the structure is meaningful in examining the aesthetic features of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in relation to the theme of queer sexuality in the text, it falls short in reading its intertextual significance. In other words, it falls short in reading the Daedalus-Icarus myth that is pervasive in both the motif of labyrinth and the relationship between Bruce and Alison. Given that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opens with a scene of Bruce and Alison playing the Icarian games, and closes with the same reference to that same Ovidian myth, it is more than apt to consider the symbolic dimensions of the labyrinth in relation to Daedalus, the creator of that particular maze, and Icarus, its (perhaps indirect) victim.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this, it becomes evident that the labyrinthine structure not only functions stylistically but also thematically, in that this myth as an intertext is intricately connected to the ways in which labyrinth-creating can be an artist-becoming, and how this artist-becoming can be a way of Icarus overcoming his masterful father, Daedalus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, paying attention to the intertextual representation of trauma in focus to the labyrinthine structure of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this paper takes the opportunity to thematically understand the labyrinthine aesthetic and intertextuality</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I will first discuss Bruce Bechdel as a type of Daedalus and illuminate that he also aspires to be an artist. His practice of art serves him as a point of escape from the heteronormative order that he resides in. The next section of the paper centers around the labyrinth as a motif that embodies a trauma. Delineating the parallels between the conditions of being captured in a labyrinth and being traumatized, I suggest that labyrinth-creating is also an artist-becoming. Ultimately, in the last section, being queer in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is reevaluated as doing queer. Queer doing is done through queering of intertexts, and this provides an opportunity to read stylistic features of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as themes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bechdel&rsquo;s intertextual process of representation as a therapeutic practice that not only lets Alison leave the labyrinth of Bruce&rsquo;s creation, but also allows her to be a Daedalus of her own right.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Alison Bechdel escapes from Bruce&rsquo;s labyrinth like a Theseus, suffers his violent artfulness like an Icarus, and creates her own labyrinth like a Daedalus. Revisiting, rereading, and rewriting this modernist intertexts, Bechdel produces her own graphic labyrinth as the artist of her own making, embracing yet rising above her traumatic past.&nbsp;</span></p>'},{__typename:a},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a graphic narrative embodies the construction of a bricolage through Bechdel&rsquo;s extensive employment of pieces of intertexts, there can be found another creator of such a bricolage, perhaps on a more spatial level: Bruce Bechdel, with his &ldquo;gothic revival house&rdquo; (8). &ldquo;Daedalus of Decor&rdquo; (6) are one of the first words to introduce and describe Bruce. His passion for decoration is continuous and obsessive, to an extent that Alison says: &ldquo;It was his passion. And I mean passion in every sense of the word,&rdquo; &ldquo;Libidinal. Manic. Martyred&rdquo; (7). Bruce maniacally decorates his place, sacrificing practicality: a martyr of his libidinal passion for beauty, even more so in that he died while doing some garden work. It is further related: &ldquo;The gilt cornices, the marble fireplace, the crystal chandeliers, the shelves for calf-bound books</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;these were not so much bought as produced from thin air by father&rsquo;s remarkable legerdemain. My father could spin garbage&hellip; into gold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (5-6). If Bechdel engages with the so-called high modernist texts to create a narrative within the area of pop culture, Bruce makes trash into gold. Bruce&rsquo;s artwork is then spatially intertextual and thus holds reversed resemblances to Bechdel&rsquo;s artwork, in which she actively adds, alters, and displaces his favorite texts, spinning Bruce&rsquo;s library into </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruce Bechdel as a Daedalus-bricoleur is not only important because it has structural parallels with the construction of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but also because it provides an escape to Bruce. His House functions as a type of heterotopia. Originally a term coined by Michel Foucault in &ldquo;Of Other Spaces,&rdquo; it is conceptualized as &ldquo;Real places [...] which are something like counter-sites, a kind of effectively enacted utopia in which real sites, all the other real sites can be found within the culture, are simultaneously represented, contested, and inverted&rdquo; (3-4). In this sense, when Bechdel calls Bruce&rsquo;s library a &ldquo;fully operational&rdquo; (61) fantasy, it seems to be in line with such definition of heterotopia. Bruce lived as a closeted gay man yet he also lived as a father, an English teacher, and a manager of a funeral home family business. In other words, he operated in the heteronormative community of Beech Creek, a small village where all his family members lived in close proximity. Yet while it is true that Bruce uses his home as an &ldquo;exhibit&rdquo; (13) that became a &ldquo;simulacrum of [a home]&rdquo; (17), in which his children acted as props to render an &ldquo;air of authenticity&rdquo; to perfect his presentation as &ldquo;an ideal husband and father,&rdquo; (17) it is also this home space where he held relationships with his more &ldquo;sexually&rdquo; promising students (61, 65). Given this setting, it seems evident that Bruce&rsquo;s gothic revival house reflects, inverts and escapes the heteronormative order of Beech Creek: a heterotopia in which Bruce and embody an alternate identity and interactions.&nbsp;</span></p>'},{__typename:a},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What adds a symbolic dimension to reading Bruce&rsquo;s home as an intertextual heterotopia is that it is likened to a labyrinth. The labyrinth is a specifically Daedalusean creation. These parallels seem simple: Bruce, a character equated with Daedalus, creates a home, similar to a labyrinth. Alison says, &ldquo;My father [...] was also Daedalus</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;that skillful artificer, that mad scientist who [...] designed the famous labyrinth&hellip; and who answered not to the laws of society, but to those of his craft</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (7). Ovid&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metamorphoses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illustrates the labyrinth of Daedalus as an intricate structure designed to confine the monstrous creature Minotaur, eradicating all chances of his escape (Ovid 176-178). In this sense, the labyrinth has two innate features. First, it is inescapable; second, its ways are misleading and illusory. Bruce&rsquo;s home, it it is a labyrinth, demonstrates such inescapability and illusoriness as well:&nbsp;</span></p>'},{__typename:n},{__typename:n},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The above two pages indicate that the Minotaur hiding in Bruce&rsquo;s &ldquo;greatest creation&rdquo; (12) as his &ldquo;self-loathing&rdquo; (20). The extravaganza of the gothic house becomes deceptive decorations, rendering an illusion of a perfect family where Bruce&rsquo;s &ldquo;shame&rdquo; (20) looms behind floral wallpapers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The labyrinthine structure has inevitable connections with the overarching theme of trauma. On the one hand, Bechdel sees such Minotaur as an inspiration of artistry that produced the masterful prison. On the other, in saying that &ldquo;escape was impossible,&rdquo; (12) she understands that she herself is inescapably trapped in Bruce&rsquo;s labyrinth. This matter is once more complicated, as the ways in which trauma haunts the traumatized have affinities with the ways one attempts to escape from a labyrinth. A path seems promising</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;yet it does not lead them outside. Likewise, an &ldquo;outside&rdquo; to trauma is not an easy thing to imagine. Furthermore, Alison as the traumatized has a sense of guilt which leads her to backtrace the reasons behind Bruce&rsquo;s death, and her times with Bruce. Such &ldquo;backtracing,&rdquo; an afterwardliness, is precisely a characteristic of trauma. Conceptualized as &ldquo;Nachtr&auml;glichkeit&rdquo; in Freudian terms, trauma has a &ldquo;mode of belated understanding or retroactive attribution&rdquo; (de Lauretis, 118). Constant revisits to and from the past then characterizes the condition of being traumatized. Yet Alison is even reluctant to let go of the idea that she is somehow responsible for his death, as it is the &ldquo;last, tenuous bond&rdquo; (86) between them. In this sense, Alison is lost in the labyrinth of trauma, the trauma-labyrinth being Bruce&rsquo;s last creation, his suicide.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reading of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a labyrinth itself manifests its full significance at this point: Bechdel creates a labyrinth as the daughter of Daedalus whilst being confined in the labyrinth as if an Ariadne. Chute paraphrases Bechdel&rsquo;s conception of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a labyrinth like thus:</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s narrative, as mentioned, is not linear and chronological; instead, it has a circling, &ldquo;labyrinthine&rdquo; structure. The structure of the book reflects a labyrinth, in Bechdel&rsquo;s words, because it spirals in to the double-spread center of Roy posing in his underwear on his bed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;that is, into the redrawn photograph of her childhood babysitter with whom her father was having an affair&mdash;and then spirals out (&ldquo;A Conversation with Alison Bechdel&rdquo;). And it is recursive. (183)&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bechdel confronts that photograph of Roy, the knowledge she has about Bruce&rsquo;s sexuality becomes so much more than just a piece of secretive information. She sees through the photograph, with her eyes, and sees how Bruce saw Roy at the moment, Roy the object of his desire and love. Here it is more than a mere revelation of a secret&mdash;it is an identification. This is the climatic moment of Bechdel&rsquo;s trauma, not in that it is the most distressing event but in that what used to remain fragmented and incomprehensible, Bruce&rsquo;s sexuality, comes to be understood and relatable. Alison sees the photograph, glimpses upon her father&rsquo;s illicit desires towards the young babysitter, and identifies such desires with her own. It finally falls into place. Alison contemplates upon the situation in which the picture was taken, saying: &ldquo;Perhaps I identify too well with my father&rsquo;s illicit awe. A trace of this seems caught in the photo, just as a trace of Roy has been caught on the light-sensitive paper&rdquo; (101). In this sense, this double-spread is none other than the Minotaur captured by Bechdel as the creator of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet this Minotaur is conquered, and in a sense, embraced. This Minotaur is less monstrous and more intimate. The Minotaur recounting her father&rsquo;s romantic moment with her teenage babysitter becomes that monster that resides in the intricate labyrinth Bechdel herself laid out. Then, ultimately, as a creator of a labyrinth, Bechdel herself replaces her Daedalus father and comes to be a Daedalus of her own making.</span></p>'},{__typename:a},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of this labyrinth of parallels and transversals between Alison and Bruce, it is also crucial to illuminate that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also part of queer literature. Instead of focusing on the author&rsquo;s sexuality, I would like to rethink this issue in terms of intertextuality, because it seems that textual engagement allows a chance to think about queer as a verb, a doing. Despite her employment of canonical, thus arguably institutionalized and &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; texts, Bechdel unapologetically creates </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a quintessential work of not only a graphic novel, but also of a queer narrative. Extending the parallels between Alison and Bruce further, in terms of their labyrinth-creating and sexuality, one reaches the ways to reconsider the text-topia of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> functioning as a type of heterotopia, similarly to how Bruce&rsquo;s home and his library were a heterotopia assuring him a limited yet firm escape from Beech Creek. Given that what Bechdel seeks to flee from is rather her trauma than the heteronormativity of the tiny village, it becomes critical to understand whether the process of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-creating and labyrinth-creating could have been an escape, or therapeutic to the trauma. On one level, her work as a queer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bricolage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> becomes therapeutic because in her process of creating </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she had to redraw therefore reenact every single scene and text that is part of the haunting past. It is significant that &ldquo;Nothing was scanned for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">; instead, documents were repeated&mdash;imitated&mdash;by Bechdel&rsquo;s own hand in the production of the book&rdquo; (Chute 183). In Bechdel&rsquo;s process of revisiting, rewriting, rereading and re-presenting the intertexts she engages in, she confronts her trauma through her body by the act of reproducing the texts. If belated understanding is the primary characteristic of trauma, and if the impossibility to comprehend is what is precisely agonizing about trauma, such bodily reenactments are an attempt at therapy to that Bechdel is confined by.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikki Sullivan argues that, &ldquo;if we turn to queer as a verb (to queer) [on the dictionary,] we find &lsquo;to quiz or ridicule, to spoil, put out of order&rsquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; (52). Then, on another level, actions of tracing and drawing are doings that constitute &ldquo;queer as a verb&rdquo; (50), and the action of queering canonical literature is not only subversive, but also ironically conciliatory.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In this sense, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is rather a queering, or a queered narrative than a queer narrative</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a story of enacting the queer. Bechdel says that Alison used to repeatedly draw pictures in her copy of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ulysses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while taking a course on the work as a college student (209). When asked for the reason, she responds: &ldquo;it was sort of like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fuck you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fuck you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to my dad and to James Joyce&rdquo; (Chute 204). This making of &ldquo;intergenerational palimpsest&rdquo; (204) on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ulysses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manifests the queering functions of queer doing. By spoiling its pages, by physically dominating the page spaces of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ulysses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, her copy becomes a subversive palimpsest where signs of her creation tackle the revered words of James Joyce. Furthermore, by displacing such texts and breaking them down to pieces of tools for usage in her creation, she queers, in other words puts them out of order and disrupts them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, on the other hand, because the literary references of her work dominantly come from her father, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also be read as a textual cooperation, a reconciliation of two types of texts. Regarding this, Chute argues: &ldquo;Bechdel uses [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ulysses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] on her own terms to understand their relationship: She no longer has to write over it with her own drawings, but can incorporate it into her own drawings&rdquo; (&ldquo;Gothic Revival&rdquo; 3). It seems that this incorporation can be shifted to be thought as a cooperation. The intertexts that weave through </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are there as a way for Bechdel not only to portray and understand Bruce but as a way to delineate a type of reconciliation. Then the intertextual representation of trauma goes beyond generic or stylistic features and fully becomes therapeutic to Alison: her queering of Bruce&rsquo;s favorite texts is both subversive and conciliatory. Bechdel reconciles with her father through reflecting upon him by the texts of his love; and subverts the texts by queering them. She at once overcomes and overthrows the site of her capturer</span></p>'},{__typename:n},{__typename:s,isKorean:t,text:'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Old father, Old artificer, stand me now and ever in good stead&rdquo;&mdash;prays Stephen Dedalus, at the end of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Portrait</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (276). Seamus Deane explains this prayer as an embodiment of Stephen&rsquo;s hope that he, as the son of Daedalus, will become like the father and survive to create his own labyrinth (329). It is true that Bechdel lives and creates her own labyrinth and becomes a Daedalus, she does not go so far as Stephen, who denounces his father Simon Dedalus and &lsquo;Heavenly Father,&rsquo; and truly embraces the spiritual paternity with Daedalus. Instead of denying Bruce, Bechdel tries to revive her perhaps failed biological paternity and relocates it on a spiritual level. Thinking of the fact that the word &lsquo;fun home&rsquo; that Bechdels use come from Bechdel&rsquo;s Funeral Home, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Home </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a way of Bechdel to finally bury Bruce, to give him a funeral, and to sing an eulogy for him. When Bruce was alive, their relationship was precarious, and meaningful connections with Bruce were at best vicarious. It is after Bruce&rsquo;s death that Bechdel embraces, fully embraces the vicarious-ity of his paternity by intertextually representing their relationship, and her trauma, using this intertextuality as a mean to both subvert and cooperate with her father. The lost time, the unpresentable remembrance of things past, can only be represented through mediation and through the recollecting of scattered fragments and references, only making such intertextuality inevitable. Bechdel creates a labyrinth, literally confronting her trauma through her bodily remark on each page of her narrative, and &ldquo;leap[s]&rdquo; (232) as an artist. She backtraces her trauma like a Theseus, and becomes a fatherless Icarus, sonless Daedalus&mdash;relocating this mythological parallel within her own, queered narrative.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Fall 2018)</span></p>'}],seo:{description:"Therapeutic Intertextuality in Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic",image:{alt:e,url:Ws,responsiveImage:{bgColor:J,aspectRatio:.7864554888039322,height:1831,sizes:"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px",src:Ws,webpSrcSet:"https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 360w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 720w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 1080w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg?fm=webp 1440w",srcSet:"https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg?dpr=0.25 360w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg?dpr=0.5 720w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg?dpr=0.75 1080w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg 1440w",width:1440,alt:e,base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoIEAgPFg0NDhANDQ0WFRMNDRENFxUZGBYVFhUaHysjGh0oHRUWJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLBQUFEAUFEC8cFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIABkAEwMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAaAAACAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBgABBQMC/8QAHhAAAQQCAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECBBEDMQUSMiH/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Aa5UlrW7AGZ2q+7MjkuT6t9A8Wf2bdgNKSG1sgtLydLssDAl53ZfllYsq48ezk4tfAHh0p3ZfpAZ3pSAf/9k=",title:e}},title:zs}}],isLoaderAnimationDone:t,isAnimatingPages:t,activePage:Gs,prepPage:Gs,firstLoad:i,showSlug:t,about:{links:[{url:o,title:"Read her writer's statement",content:"here.",reference:{slug:ge,title:oe}},{url:o,title:"Email",content:"alexheeyeonkil@gmail.com",reference:e},{url:qs,title:ks,content:xs,reference:e}],slug:"about",title:"About",description:'<p class="font_6"><span class="color_15"><span>Alex Heeyeon Kil is a writer and independent researcher based in Seoul and Berlin. </span></span><span class="color_15"><span>Her research addresses topics of </span></span><span class="color_15"><span>memory, food, and writing.</span></span></p>\n<div>\n  <div><span>CV is available upon request.

Archiving </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduces a dilemma that is directly related to the function of an archive. Archiving, or writing history, is in itself already an activity </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predicated on the acts of exclusion. It has to decide what has to be included and what has to be left out. So, creating an archive regarding this erased memory site proposes a representational problem in which one must continuously be conscious of the responsibilities regarding </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to represent.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a polyphonic account of a polytemporal experience,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this project experiments with the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ways in which writing can be done to visually reflect the pasts present, and presents past.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This project relies on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two axes, one personal and the other historical. Each fragment of writing is dated. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The personal axis consists of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">my experience dating an American soldier, the field trips I took outside Seoul to different </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s, about the time I was offered a job in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and about the time when I actually did work as a &ldquo;bartender&rdquo; at a bar serving drinks to old men and letting them fondle me for tips. The historical axis consists of various representations of&nbsp;<em>gijichon</em>, in literature and in journalism. The biggest component of this axis is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">old newspaper articles corresponding to the date of my personal experience.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the personal and the historical, this project thinks of the ways in which the histories that are not immediately mine come into my experience in the present, which not only politicizes the personal but redefines the personal as ultimately palimpsestuous. Lastly, departing from authorized narratives of that past, this intimate rewriting of pasts present navigates between collective amnesia and aphasia: things are perhaps never forgotten but made ungraspable amidst the opacity of palimpsests.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open for further collaboration.</span></p>',"#9b522d",1.54983922829582,"(max-width: 964px) 100vw, 964px","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1606593131-screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-8-16-21-pm.png?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 241w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1606593131-screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-8-16-21-pm.png?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 482w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1606593131-screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-8-16-21-pm.png?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 723w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1606593131-screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-8-16-21-pm.png?fm=webp 964w","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1606593131-screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-8-16-21-pm.png?dpr=0.25 241w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1606593131-screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-8-16-21-pm.png?dpr=0.5 482w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1606593131-screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-8-16-21-pm.png?dpr=0.75 723w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1606593131-screen-shot-2020-11-28-at-8-16-21-pm.png 964w","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoIEAgLFQ4VDhgQDQ0NDhENFg0MFxwZGBYfFhUaHysjGh0oHRUWJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLDg0OHBAOEC8dFh07Ly8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIABAAGAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAXAAADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABQYH/8QAHxAAAAUEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFESFBBhMx/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwIB/8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECITH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANcfWSEGIytTkE9a+w9nzD6jEFWHlOSPdiWxIKy449LSbZZAENCkKbbLIBqDlp//2Q==","on-kimchi","142956388","Pretty dishes neatly arranged, unlike the memories layered over my chest, my head, and my present.",.6651270207852193,"(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731642-screen-shot-2021-06-16-at-9-08-59-pm.png?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 72w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731642-screen-shot-2021-06-16-at-9-08-59-pm.png?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 144w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731642-screen-shot-2021-06-16-at-9-08-59-pm.png?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 216w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731642-screen-shot-2021-06-16-at-9-08-59-pm.png?fm=webp 288w","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731642-screen-shot-2021-06-16-at-9-08-59-pm.png?dpr=0.25 72w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731642-screen-shot-2021-06-16-at-9-08-59-pm.png?dpr=0.5 144w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731642-screen-shot-2021-06-16-at-9-08-59-pm.png?dpr=0.75 216w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731642-screen-shot-2021-06-16-at-9-08-59-pm.png 288w","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoICA4NCg0LDg8QDg0LDREKFhENFxMZGBYTIhUaHysjGh0oHRUWJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLBQUFEAUFEC8cFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIABkAEAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAXAAEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAwcB/8QAHxAAAAUEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQFERIhFDM0/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/ANDaTZ0h2rLtGFVpwcIDrKj4ugDZWnCBKmnOKFTewhCf5QH/2Q==",'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mom sells her kimchi when she&rsquo;s bored. She makes a whole variety of them. Cucumber kimchi in the summer, and water kimchi with flowered carrots for festive occasions. When she is open for sale, my mom decorates her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kakaostory</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with pictures of her at the market picking out vegetables. She posts explaining each ingredient and whose hands were responsible for them to get to her kitchen counter.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week or two after she&rsquo;s made a new batch of scallion kimchi, we put pork belly on the pan. Take a lettuce leaf and start loading; a small spoonful of rice, a piece of pork belly, a slice of raw or roasted garlic, some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ssamjang</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a bit of the kimchi. Stuffing ourselves with these wraps of fragile green leaves, all we really talk about is how much pork belly Uly, my dog, should be allowed to eat. All I want to think or say seems to slip away from me, washed down with cold cans of beer. We&rsquo;re filling our stomachs. And on the table devoid of any meaningful conversation, the sizzling and the crunching fill that peculiar silence.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&rsquo;t necessarily get along with my mom, but I always do with the things she chose to feed me. Especially her kimchi, because it&rsquo;s really, too good. But before the taste, what comes into my mind first is always the color. The bright red color. It&rsquo;s never a devilish red though, its redness does not scream spicy, salty, nor fishy. It&rsquo;s fiery, but it&rsquo;s also soft. It&rsquo;s a red that is transparent and optimistic. It is a red that invites then assures. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gochugaru</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she uses is quite special: she has this number she hits up when she needs it; the guy shows up in a car with dark windows; and he does not take tikkie. Depending on the kimchi, she will use apples or pears, sometimes both. When she&rsquo;s in the mood my mom also puts little strands of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">chopi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fruits. In her winter cabbage kimchi, she adds chopped pieces of raw hairtail fish. The fish gets kind of cured in the pot; the kimchi gives some to the fish, and the fish gives some of itself to the kimchi. In the end the fish becomes this nutty thing. For the fish sauce, she prefers the ones made with small sand eels, over those with anchovies. Sand eels are green. And its fermented form, so extremely fermented that the fish is no longer decipherable, definitely smells disgusting. Yet in the kimchi, it disappears; only leaving this unmistakable trace, a subtle freshness. A fermentation layered over another. Layers of time. Again, lay this kimchi on your spoonful of rice. Maybe layer it with a piece of hairtail. On top of a seaweed paper. Stuff yourself.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&rsquo;t necessarily get along with my mom, in fact, I am disgusted by my parents when I talk about them over my therapist&rsquo;s desk. I remember that one summer evening we went to an eels barbeque. I don&rsquo;t like eels. That evening I saw my dad for the first time in 37 hours, and that 37 hours ago he had called me something. Sitting on the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">jungja </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">outside the apartment, I told my mom to please fuck off. I don&rsquo;t want anything to do with them. I said I cannot live with the memories of the family. All the layers of time they brought into my life when they brought me into my life. Crying. Begging. Let me go. I hate those layers, just please fuck off from everything. The next morning, I went to therapy, then spent the day staring at a wall in Starbucks chewing on bananas. But when I faced them at that table, I had to eat. Sizzle and crunch. What cute thing did Uly do today? Everything slips away. Really, eels are too slimy. Against my repulsion, against my desperate clinging onto my hatred&mdash;like the fish sauce, the disgust becomes something else. I evaporate. What is left in my mouth is something that is unforgettable yet traceless. Traceless like the fish sauce; but absolutely nothing is subtle. Nothing is fresh in my mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a million different types of kimchi and there are about half a million things that can go into it. Salt and sugar for pickling. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aekjeot</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all kinds of sea animals, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gochugaru</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, garlic, giner, onion, scallion, chives, radish, apple, pears, rice&hellip; But if you asked my mom what the most important ingredient is, I know she will say time. Time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is only after the right amount of time that the pot of kimchi can be opened.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am never sure what kind of a woman my mom is. I don&rsquo;t know about her past dreams and her future aspirations. I am utterly ignorant about the ways she deals with her sadness or loneliness. I wonder if she truly enjoys her lunch dates with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ajummas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with colorful Birkins and stories of their lawyer daughters and in-laws. I wonder how those stories make her feel about her own daughter, who left to &hellip; where? Netherlands? New Zealand?, and who keeps dating boys too colorful for her own taste. I don&rsquo;t know what her fun looks like. Or maybe I do, but simply unable or unwilling to relate. I don&rsquo;t understand why she never left my dad, although she regularly says she will. I wonder if it is similar to the way she regularly says she will get an eye lift but never does. I wonder if that&rsquo;s what love is. I wonder if forgiveness is indispensable in the way she loves.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder what she thinks when she makes kimchi. I wonder where her little smile comes from, each time we eat at her table. I wonder if that coffee she goes to drink after my dad&rsquo;s manic fit makes her really feel better. Because it doesn&rsquo;t make me feel any better. Because after each coffee, after each &ldquo;I am never coming back,&rdquo; she always comes home.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe I know all the answers but I don&rsquo;t want to. How many layers of time will I have to travel through? When will I open?</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been almost two years since I moved to Amsterdam. I&rsquo;m going home in May. I already know my mom will put some crazy shit across the table for me the evening of my arrival. Neatly laid out on the table, the rice next to the soup. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banchan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the main dish. Freshly cut kimchi. Cold cans of beer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty dishes neatly arranged, unlike the memories layered over my chest, my head, and my present. We will know just by the appearance, the food on the table is good. We will sit down and sizzle, crunch, chew, swallow. We understand this is good food, this is a good time. But perhaps we will never understand each other.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or perhaps, just perhaps, we understand each other too much. Making it impossible to love. But also impossible to not love.</span></p>','<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">17 March 2022</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex</span></p>',"Memories of the Mother","on-the-eating-subaltern","102907375","<p>The Edible Unrepresentable in (Post)Colonial South Korea</p>","11 February 1964, US Serviceman Shoots Again\n",.822265625,"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731324-screen-shot-2021-12-20-at-7-06-29-pm.png?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 105w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731324-screen-shot-2021-12-20-at-7-06-29-pm.png?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 210w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731324-screen-shot-2021-12-20-at-7-06-29-pm.png?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 315w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731324-screen-shot-2021-12-20-at-7-06-29-pm.png?fm=webp 421w","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731324-screen-shot-2021-12-20-at-7-06-29-pm.png?dpr=0.25 105w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731324-screen-shot-2021-12-20-at-7-06-29-pm.png?dpr=0.5 210w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731324-screen-shot-2021-12-20-at-7-06-29-pm.png?dpr=0.75 315w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643731324-screen-shot-2021-12-20-at-7-06-29-pm.png 421w","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBhQOFAgLBw0PDRUNDg0NERENDRENFx8ZGBYTFhUaHysjGh0oHRUWJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLBQUFEAUFEC8cFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIABkAFAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAYAAADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwUEAf/EAB8QAAEEAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEMgURIjFBIf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwC1dkTc36a7eMn3YHKvRS0uJUjAe9vIB7mfQA5apIvg2pXRjOjRZCHABLk5AdfkAH//2Q==",'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 18 September 1952, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chosun Ilbo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publishes an article reporting the realities of civilian life in Seoul bulldozered by the Korean War.

Changgook does not return home that night. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dong-A Ilbo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports on the 11th that he is hospitalized at 43rd US Field Hospital after being hit by one of the two shots a nameless private had fired. It is said that he &ldquo;crossed the fence into the base of First Corporation, B Company, 51th Signal Battalion, located in Uijeongbu&rdquo; to &ldquo;scavenge breadcrumbs and ingredients for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kkulkkulijuk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo; He was shot while running away, after being caught.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 1968, Richard Nixon wins his second term of presidency. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kyunghyang Shinmun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publishes an article on the victory of this man who &ldquo;enjoys listening to Beethoven.&rdquo; The article ends on a hopeful note, bringing forward Nixon&rsquo;s apparent pro-South Korea tendencies. It says, &ldquo;He has always been friendly to Korea, even tasting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kkulkkulijuk </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Dongdaemun Market.&rdquo; If he eats American garbage like we do, that must mean he supports us, right?</span></p>','<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kkulkkuli</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, piggy, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">juk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, porridge, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kkulkkulijuk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a literal garbage porridge in which its contents were boiled until indiscernible: food suitable for pigs, and not necessarily humans. Yet the porridge wasn&rsquo;t suitable for any living things; many humans died from it&mdash;choked on used condoms and poisoned by cigarette butts. &ldquo;If you are lucky, you could find a big piece of meat. If not, your bowl might just be full of cigarette butts,&rdquo; says one article on 22 December 1960, while describing the popularity of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kkulkkulijuk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sellors in Namdaemun market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearing the end of the Korean War and finally by the 1960s, the eating of American garbage was not so much an activity done at an individual level; instead of going to the garbage bins yourself and finding food for your own consumption, there was a dubious yet real supply chain made of a team of &ldquo;whoever runs the fastest&rdquo; (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chosun Ilbo, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 February 1953). These fast runners secured the garbage and sold them to street food vendors who then turned the ingredients into </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kkulkkulijuk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is possible that Changgook was a fast runner, whose 12 year old body was a good size to sneak into American bases. It is not known if he survived the gunshots. He disappears into the void of historical recognition. Yet it seems that his shadows loom behind many small historical incidents: a boy like Changgook would have sourced the ingredients in Nixon&rsquo;s porridge.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American garbage during the war was what fed South Koreans like Mr. Kang&rsquo;s family; and after the war, what provided livelihood to kids like Changgook.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">69 years after the war ended, American garbage gave me something to write about for the thesis that will help me graduate. The general topic of my thesis is US military camptowns, towns that developed around and depended on US servicemen for its ecosystem of living and dying.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a big detour before delving into </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kkulkkulijuk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, my argument starts by defining South Korea as a US colony. There are, of course, numerous concretely factual things that evince this argument. After Korea&rsquo;s liberation from Japan, it was not the Korean flag but the Stars and Stripes that replaced the Rising Sun in government buildings across South Korea. The US military simply moved into the Japanese imperial army base, which is still there in the middle of Seoul; the US just had to claim South Korea as a trophy&mdash;as worthless as this trophy was at the time&mdash;after smashing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. South Korea was under the US military government for three years after the liberation. And when the war broke out and only came into an armistice in 1953, South Korea was not even invited to that negotiation table. The armistice was signed by China, North Korea, and the US. The US, to this date, has the wartime supreme command of South Korea.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is not so much these historical facts that I care about. By identifying South Korea as a US colony, what is made possible is&mdash;and what I think is more important&mdash;identifying forms of colonialisms that are distinctly different from old European colonialisms, which still dictate and limit our imagination and understanding of what colonialism looks like. This in turn enables a recognition of fluid and permeating modes of violence and perpetration, and not just outright conquest and concrete exploitation. What is also important is the discourse enabled by thinking of South Korea as a &ldquo;colonized,&rdquo; not just in its starving past but also in its present BTS glory: the colonized position takes many different forms and appearances.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, we live. Colonial powers, or any violence, is never an impenetrable oppression. It is in fact porous; the bodies on the other side of power must navigate the landscape given to them and negotiate the powers that might limit their movements. They desire and therefore they live. Because one cannot simply stop desiring, they must repave this landscape so they can live. The collision between the American empire and Korean people seem to be less ideological, but more corporeal. The need to eat does not care about ideologies. But it is what we eat that literally make up the physical body that we are. If you are what you eat, what does </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kkulkkulijuk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make of Koreans?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens between Washington DC and Moskow can hurt Changgook. What may go down in Nha Trang can beat up the Korean sex workers providing &lsquo;service&rsquo; to American servicemen. Why is that? How is Nixon and Changgook related, in this myriad of power and its unexpected operation in the most unknown corner of Seoul?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I write with much confidence, I am secretly very lost about my thesis. I don&rsquo;t know if I am drawing too much of a na&iuml;ve picture. I cannot erase the feeling that this argument isn&rsquo;t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">academic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enough. And after almost 4 years of 2 Masters, this gives me an incomprehensible amount of insecurity. I don&rsquo;t want to write my thesis in a way that highlights </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">human</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> struggle, and how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">humans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arise even in the most devastating of situations with the utmost will to survive. I feel like maybe my arguments beautify such struggle, which, I fear, may legitimize the oppressions that bred that struggle to begin with. At the same time, while I cannot afford optimism, I still want to be on the side of hope.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To an extent, Koreans still enjoy eating American garbage. Of course, we don&rsquo;t have to scavenge garbage bins anymore. We eat Spam, so much Spam. And it is the key ingredient in the modern rendition of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kkulkkulijuk</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">budaejjigae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning military base, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">jjigae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, stew, it is a spicy stew laden with Heinz baked beans, yellow American cheese, hotdogs, corned beef, ramen noodles, and Spam. While the name of the stew unapologetically pronounces its origins, the origins of this stew, or the colonial implications of it, are forgotten; or rather, made irrelevant in the face of the stew&rsquo;s nonchalant deliciousness. Just like the way the Korean War came to be known as the Forgotten War.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am finishing off today&rsquo;s story thinking about Spam and a certain Professor B. Spam, as a Korean pantry staple, is a very common Thanksgiving present in South Korea. And Professor B, a white Italian American in Seoul, a bit of a frustrated University of Chicago PhD who thought himself too good to be teaching in Korea. I remember the vivid shock on his face when he was given Spam from the university. I remember him telling us how offended he was about this holiday gift: giving garbage meat to me, a professor?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was teaching George Elliot in a classroom full of Spam eaters. Mr. Kang, Changgook, Richard Nixon, Victorian Literature, Professor B, and Spam. That&rsquo;s all I have to say for today.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">31 March 2022</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex</span></p>',"Does the Subaltern Eat?","on-naengmyeon","142956264","<p>The cold noodle soup and the North Korean diaspora</p>","Sometimes stories have too many entrances that they become impossible to enter.

His death meant nothing to my reality: I was in Amsterdam, he died on a hospital bed in Seoul. Jungcheon&rsquo;s absence only took shape a few weeks ago, when I learned that after his death, Duckwon cries when she has to be alone. They spent 70 years together. Duckwon cries like I cry in Amsterdam, unable to deal with a suffocating loneliness. But I am 28 and she is 90 years old, she can&rsquo;t exactly go do things. She has become so small. As life is leaving her body, she looks more and more like a dried anchovy. She sits in her huge apartment in her small body. All she does all day is waiting to die.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mostly had an immense sense of FOMO that week of Jungcheon&rsquo;s death. I wanted to see my brother carry Jungcheon&rsquo;s picture at the front of the march, and my friends carrying the casket to the limousine that took Jungcheon&rsquo;s body and the family to the crematory. Most of all I wanted to see Duckwon crying over the coffin in her Issey Miyake dress, somehow standing on her tiny tiny ankles. I am not sure why her outfit left such an impression on me.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a type of white water kimchi that consists mostly of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and brine. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a root vegetable, and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is similar to what we call daikon radish. It is shorter and fatter. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a very self-protective vegetable. The thickness of the skin on an autumn </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might tell you how cold that year&rsquo;s winter might be. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dong</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means winter and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">chimi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an old word for kimchi. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dongchimi </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a winter kimchi served in a small bowl. We drink the brine and eat the pieces of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because it is a winter kimchi, it is characteristic of the colder northern regions of Korea. Food is traditionally milder there. So </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is white&mdash;not red&mdash;and when it&rsquo;s on the table, it means it&rsquo;s winter.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jungcheon was a smart man whose life was not so much about living, but more about surviving the circumstances he found himself in.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">naengmyeon </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">restaurants in Seoul, and most of them are very old. By old, I mean they&rsquo;ve existed since before the war, or came into existence shortly after the war. I don&rsquo;t really like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so I haven&rsquo;t gone since I was quite young. And my memories of the clientele there were that those men were as old as the restaurants themselves. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the food of the North Korean diaspora in South Korea. The specific type of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I am most familiar with comes from Pyongyang. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not cheap to make: the form that is established in South Korea is its older version, before the North Korean Famine: because restaurant owners came to the South before the famine. The newer version tastes and looks quite different, I heard. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naeng</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means cold, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">myeon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is noodles. They come in thin metal bowls with slices of meat, a half of a boiled egg, and pickled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and/or cucumbers. Topped with some green onions and a bit of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gochugaru</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on the restaurant, it might also contain pheasant meatballs. The noodles are grayish brown, made with buckwheats. These noodles are long, they are not cut. The servers would cut them with scissors once it&rsquo;s served. Everything in the bowl is cold: like ice in the broth or the broth itself would be like a slushy. The broth is a mixture of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dongchimi </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and beef stock, and because it is served cold, every hint of fat has been skimmed. It is so fucking mild, like it does not have taste. But you must, I am told, breathe&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if I don&rsquo;t breathe when I eat other types of noodles, but apparently with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you must breathe with your nose gently to feel the scent of the buckwheat and the slightest taste of the broth.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed when Jungcheon was 18 years old. He was born in Pyongyang, and there was no such thing as North Korea then. After the bombings, the Japanese, in defeat, left Korea and suddenly that impoverished land was free. The landscape on this peninsula was changing rapidly and it was already divided along the 38th parallel. But his entire family was able to simply walk across and move to the South. Jungcheon was 23 years old when the war broke out. But he never fought. At the beginning of the war, Jungcheon was a student at Seoul National University. Going to that school meant so much at the time, and it still does now. People had no time for school at the time, they were digging US military&rsquo;s garbage bins. But Jungcheon was digging into engineering books at the most prestigious university, founded by the Japanese Empire. Towards the end of the war, he was a math teacher at a high school. One day, all the teachers were lined up and were to be taken somewhere to be enlisted as soldiers. He ran away from the queue. He later became a professor.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daddy issues are like a locket, a heirloom, an everlasting inheritance my family carries generation after another. Kyeseon was Jungcheon&rsquo;s father, and he hated his son. Suk is Jungcheon&rsquo;s son, and Suk did not particularly love his father either. Kyeseon didn&rsquo;t like Jungcheon because Jungcheon was born from another woman. And Jungcheon was never satisfied with Suk because Suk never got into Seoul National University. When Jungcheon was young&mdash;living through colonial-postcolonial-war-postwar times&mdash;he decided that you might as well die if you were stupid. And if you didn&rsquo;t go to Seoul National University, you were stupid. Maybe he thought only by his smartness can he be acknowledged as a worthwhile son, still worthy to be fed. I am not sure. Jungcheon was anxious that his son would be a failure. But the war was already over more than 20 years ago, and while terrible things were still happening on this land, Jungcheon was rich enough now to not be affected and Suk was reckless enough to not care. Suk did not want to prove much. Times of proving oneself were over. Suk never got into Seoul National University. Their relationship was conflicted until Jungcheon died.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Jungcheon&rsquo;s funeral Suk said two sentences. &ldquo;My father was a man who loved more than he ever received. Thank you for coming.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jungcheon was still breathing, he really liked to breathe into </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was his favorite thing to breathe into. Jungcheon was so particular about it. He will order it at room temperature, which is called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">guhnaeng</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No ice. Once it&rsquo;s on the table, he will never, ever cut the noodles. It will offend him. He will first drink the broth, almost two thirds of it. Then, he adds vinegar and mustard. The noodles will never not be in his mouth; one end of the strand in his throat, the other still in the bowl. Breathing through his nose.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Jungcheon died I had this brilliant idea of making </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">naengmyeon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I went with my boyfriend to Shilla, the only Korean grocery store in Amsterdam. I was looking for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mu </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was October, and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s were not fat: the weather wasn&rsquo;t hostile enough for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have to protect itself. We also went to Hema to buy a big plastic box to put </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I planned to leave it outside while it&rsquo;s fermenting. Following my mom&rsquo;s directions, I made the brine and salted the vegetables. I closed the box and put it on my balcony.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I opened it after a few weeks, it was moldy. I was very disappointed. I closed it and left it outside where it was sitting. I never opened it, until I threw it out a few weeks ago. It was rotting there for months. All blue and green. Corpse-y.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last time I talked to Jungcheon, he asked me about the weather in Amsterdam. Then he told me to eat well and stay healthy. The weather in Amsterdam was not cold enough to leave the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dongchimi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outside. The only cold thing I eat there is ice cream, when I&rsquo;m high or hung over.&nbsp;</span></p>',"Nostalgia, Grandpa's Palate, North Korean Diaspora","on-shamanic-responsibilities-of-representation","102906722","<p>Shamanic Responsibilities of Representation in &nbsp;Heinz Insu Fenkl&rsquo;s Memories of My Ghost Brother</p>","[The teacher] said that the marks showed evaporation, which was what happened to water when the sun shined on it.

In this sense, memories are palimpsestuous, as they are always reconstituted individually and collectively. Memories also fluctuate between omissions and exaggerations, mutate as they encounter different contexts, and haunt to shape the present. Memories have the critical and political potential to create ruptures in established historical narratives, through which a different narrative can enter. In examining this potential, Peter Verov&scaron;ek states that &ldquo;memory is needed to sustain the constructive power of individuals and unique human beings within self-consciously defined communities&rdquo; (6). &ldquo;The constructive power&rdquo; here refers to the communicative political power that defines an &ldquo;actor or a group in a social setting&rdquo; (5), which arises from the sense of being within a certain group, rather than that of doing certain things. By this definition, memories become the bedrock of certain communities, built upon shared experiences. Then, circulating memories within a society reconstructs communities, and through the very circulation, the legitimacy of the communities and their shared pasts is established and actualized.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet what happens to welled-up memories of an eroding landscape where its inhabitants have disappeared into social amnesia, erased if not forgotten? What happens to the memories that are not circulated in social and public discourses, when these memories are all that is left regarding the past existence of a certain landscape and its inhabitants? What power do those memories have, and what defines that community? Heinz Insu Fenkl&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories of My Ghost Brother</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1996) is a text that arises from these questions. Growing up in a US military camptown, otherwise known as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the narrator is skeptical of the unquestionably natural phenomenon of evaporation:</span></p>\n<p></p>','<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the voice of the 8 year old narrator, the above statement speaks of an important aspect of life in this town. The deluge of memories never circulates outside </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only collecting and flooding within, becoming an unbearable weight and never evaporating. There is the narrator&rsquo;s young cousin, Gannan, who comes from a rural town to work as a prostitute, only to hang herself when a &ldquo;yellow-haired GI&rdquo; (12) impregnates her and refuses to marry her. When she dies, &ldquo;a</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fter the second and the third monsoon seasons had passed, Gannan&rsquo;s grave had eroded away to nothing. It had become part of the landscape, and no one remembered where it was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (56). With her grave disappeared, her life and death are only left in memories. There is a half-black boy James, who the narrator once swears to be brothers with but never sees again after that, because his mother drowns him to marry a white GI. Learning of James&rsquo; death, the narrator says, &ldquo;[i]f it had been possible, I would have remembered James back to life&rdquo; (211). The blame, however, has nowhere to go but scatters like the &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">raindrops in a storm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (232). And there is a well, next to a GI bar with the ironic name of Apollo Club, that swallows a maiden jumping in to find her baby boy she accidentally drops into. The grievances in that well, of course, do not evaporate, but are &ldquo;paved over&rdquo; (200). The narrator wells up inside him both the magnitude of oppressive power and the depth of grief that are too immense to grasp. Losses in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are everyday events, and they go unmourned, unrepresented, then forgotten.</span></p>','<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>Precisely because the memories of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are in the realm of social amnesia, or erasure, in both American and Korean public discourses, the function of an author as someone who can discursively articulate such unknown memories becomes crucial in representing this town. The narrator of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> performs this function like a shaman, who not only articulates the memories but conjures the forgotten narratives of the dead and presents to concretize these narratives. I define the shaman according to its </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">h&agrave;nz&igrave;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> composition: 巫. This signifier comes after the ending of the narrative, and it is what closes the text. A letter constituted by placing 工, &ldquo;craftsmanship,&rdquo; between two 人s, &ldquo;human,&rdquo; the 巫 quite literally refers to the craftsmanship of connecting two humans, two different entities. The composition of 巫 presents shamanism as a matter of connection. And it is the connection that is enabled by the narrator-shaman&rsquo;s crafting of representations in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The shaman connects absence and presence by naming the erased deaths and bringing them back into the narrative. His representation altogether encompasses both memories and reflections upon those memories, and the significances of the past are generated in the present. The crafting of these connections through representations is the responsibility of the shaman. He responds to those unnamed and writes them. He responds to what he has written about them and reflects on it. When the object of loss has long been faded into oblivion, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explores the responsibilities of a shaman-author, who, through representation, conjures and protects the otherwise irrecoverable yet inescapably haunting past.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>While it is a rarely represented landscape, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demonstrates the ways in which the violent and distant conflicts of Cold War leave its inhabitants bare, vulnerable, and silent. These inhabitants include: American servicemen with the constant fear of deportation to Vietnam or attack from the North; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanggongju</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s (&ldquo;western princesses,&rdquo; a term for sex workers whose customers are exclusively American GIs), trying to escape the poverties of post-War Korea into the illusory glory of the US; and Amerasian children, whose survivals are constantly threatened by sexism and racism&mdash;sexism against their mothers and racism against their &ldquo;mixed&rdquo;ness&mdash;of both Korea and the US. As Kyung-Sook Boo convincingly argues, &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories of My Ghost Brother</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is ultimately a novel about America [despite its setting in Korea], interrogating conventional definitions of Americanness as well as the role of race, ethnicity, and choice in the construction and acknowledgement of American identity&rdquo; (126). The text is deeply American in that the spatial setting is dominated by American ideologies of racial and ethnic identity, but also that of the Cold War. What marginalizes this town from hegemonic Korean society is the very Americanness and the blatant presence of American domination. Yet the micro-tragedies of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">make it hard to define the town simply as a manifestation of Cold War politics in which South Korea was instrumentalized by and subjugated to the US military colonialism as a tactically important place, right at the border to Red Eurasia. It is also a place where the daily lives of individuals are shaped by distant powers, and perish like small flies. And like flies, their deaths disappear into oblivion.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>When the lives of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are vulnerable to deaths and deaths vulnerable to erasure, it becomes imperative to look at the sociopolitical landscape through a microscope. While it is important to investigate the macrostructures that shape the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> landscape, an investigation that focuses on the lived dimension of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been more or less absent in the previous body of research. Katharine Moon&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex Among Allies </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a decisive study that analyzes the political administrations that actually created the military prostitution for the US military in Korea. Naming the prostitution a &ldquo;permanent fixture of US-Korea relations&rdquo; (27), she states, &ldquo;[because] the institutionalizing of military prostitution involves a social, economic, and political process, overseas military prostitution must be examined in the context of interaction between foreign governments and among governments and local groups&rdquo; (12).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indeed, the governments that communicate across the Pacific also communicate in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanggongju</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo;s bedroom. Yet in the process of political investigation, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanggongju</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disappears into the vague and becomes abstracted into an embodiment of victimization of Korea by the US military colonialism. She is once again pushed to the outside of recognition.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>Grace M. Cho&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haunting the Korean Diaspora</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presents a compelling sociological and anthropological approach, centralizing and metaphorically reading the figure of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanggongju</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, turning the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanggongju</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a very real figure with a specific social occupation, again limits our understanding of this subaltern position as a lived one. Cho traces the history of the Korean war to show how that war gave birth to, and became embodied in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanggongju</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who signifies the US domination during and after the war. Cho says, &ldquo;the yanggongju became enfigured, as a ghost composed of the material remains of 1953 and the residues of the daily practices of war&rdquo; (20). Such argument is persuasive in delineating how the &ldquo;traumatic effects of colonization and war&rdquo; is accumulated in the &ldquo;diasporic unconscious&rdquo; (7), yet it is persuasive only when the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanggongju</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s are distanced and reduced as a metaphor. These women are not just a &ldquo;spectral agency&rdquo; (17) of the haunting past, they are an actual presence that is pushed off from visible and audible public discourses. In this respect, the metaphorical reading of these women is problematic: these women live, and engage in significant political struggles to represent who they are and who they used to be.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Therefore, instead of concentrating on the agency of the specter, we need to concentrate on the agency to represent, an agency that can potentially give face and voice to the abstracted and silenced micro-tragedies of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>The intricacy of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;as a place that simultaneously epitomizes US-Korea relations, Cold War politics, domestic poverty, the past histories and their persistence into the present&mdash;necessitates a shamanic engagement with this apparently political, sociological, and historical site. For this task, I redefine what Michel Foucault calls the author-function in &ldquo;What Is an Author?&rdquo; (1969) as a shaman-function in the case of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By borrowing the tongue of the dead, this shaman plurivocally conjures the stories of the erased and enunciates the ghostly presence of the powers that create both their tragedies and erasure. In the lecture, Foucault attempts to fill in the space of the dead Author who had been killed by Roland Barthes in 1967. On the one hand, this essay is essentially paradoxical. Foucault limits the function of a literary author as something that merely &ldquo;put[s] into circulation a certain number of resemblances and analogies&rdquo; (132), while his entire argument is based on Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;what matter who&rsquo;s speaking?&rdquo; (Beckett 85, Foucault 115). This paradox confesses that the author-function of generating theoretical and social discourses indeed includes, or is even inevitably related to, the function of literary writers: it is Beckett&rsquo;s utterance, not theoretically articulate yet literarily implicative, that inspires Foucault&rsquo;s critical conceptualization of the author-function. On the other hand, it is productive in the reading of a text to think of the author as</span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">a function rather than a figure who totalizes representations and significations. This function is defined by Foucault as something that &ldquo;characterize[s] the existence, circulation, and operation of certain discourses within a society&rdquo; (124), thereby conceiving the author-function as a discursive production of meanings. Based on Foucault&rsquo;s proposition, I define the shaman-function as something that conjures &ldquo;the existence, circulation, and operation of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">memories </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">within a society.&rdquo; The shaman performatively evokes and reconstitutes lost memories through the act of performative representation, which renders political powers to the acts of reading and writing about those memories. The performative power of representation is the power to generate social discourses that reconstitutes memory, which, as mentioned, shapes the present. When memories of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are not socially circulated, the entire social existence of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is threatened despite its ongoing presence.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>I locate the author&rsquo;s shamanic function in the narrator, rather than Fenkl. The narrator speaks through the first-person focal point of the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; which, in the process of storytelling, embraces much more narratives than those of already specifically named and demarcated authorial Fenkl&rsquo;s own. Foucault argues that &ldquo;[i]t would be false to seek the author in relation to the actual author as to the fictional narrator; the &lsquo;author-function&rsquo; arises out of their scission&mdash;in the division and distance of the two&rdquo; (129). In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it is the scission of the narrator from Fenkl that makes it possible for the narrator to traverse and navigate between the given present and the reconstructed memories of not just his own, but also of those of other </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inhabitants.</span></p>','<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>&ldquo;Let me tell you something important, [...] [i]f you ever count on someone to do the talking for you and you don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re really saying, you gotta assume he&rsquo;s covering his own ass&rdquo; (256), says the narrator&rsquo;s father, a white American Sergeant of German descent. This is a man who does not want to be seen with his Korean wife and Amerasian son because it &ldquo;undermines his authority&rdquo; (131). What he says about his experience with interpreters in Vietnam is quite telling. He says they are especially untrustworthy among Vietnamese, who &ldquo;you could never trust&rdquo; (256) to begin with. According to his statement, the inability to speak a language inevitably leads one to depend on interpretation that is always deceptively self-centered on the interpreter, and anyone can and should claim the autonomy of speech. The narrator of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ignores this lesson from his father, and becomes an interpreter for those whose lives are subjected, in unexpected ways, to the institution that his father is part of. The narrator does this for the people in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in particular because the deaths and lives are vulnerable and rendered silent, specifically because the ability to speak is not something that is granted universally. The narrator interprets their stories into his narrative, providing a textual space in which the voices of multiple people can coexist.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>The shaman inscribes a double layer of narration-reading and narration-writing, which plurivocally and palimpsestuously draws a portrait of the lost landscape. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is constituted by two types of chapters, one in which entire texts are italicized and the other not. The italicized chapters connote a temporal distance from the events narrated, whereas the non-italicized ones relate the past events in the present tense. As both layers of narration are immersed in nostalgia and immense sadness, it is hard to name the precise lost object that the narrator yearns for. It is a mixture of nostalgia for his childhood friends, the sight of Mahmi&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yanggongju</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> friends waiting outside the gate to be taken into the post, and the excitement in &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[their] </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">own tragedies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (138). It is a complex intermingling of overt dangers, precarious excitement, and melancholia. At the same time, the italicized chapters comment and reflect upon the pasts represented in the non-italicized chapters. Therefore, the narrator becomes a reader in the former, and a writer in the latter. It is this double narration that makes representation a re-present-ation, through which the past can be restored onto a palpable text. Confronted with the feelings without &ldquo;words or pictures for them, only darkness and a noise like the sound of rain&rdquo; (19), the narrator as the writer looks into the past as if it is a well made of such raindrops. The writer sees the depth of the well, and the reader reflects upon it. This fluctuating, mutating, and overflowing well of memories is read, written, re-read, and re-written by the double narration of the text. It is this palimpsestuous textual activity that inscribes the voice of the dead and the forgotten, mediating its erasure and representation, and reflecting on the incomprehensible complexity of the past in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is palimpsestuous because voices are written and read in layers, in a textual space that encompasses and trespasses multiple timeframes. The shamanic inscription, then, is a collaboration of reading and writing in regards to the past.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>However, there is still a distance between the reading narrator and the writing narrator that enables the plurivocality of the narrative. The author-subject disappears into this distance, and the empty signifier &ldquo;I&rdquo; is filled by different voices. &ldquo;I&rdquo; is a space anyone can enter and inhabit: the first-person perspective of this narrative is not about &ldquo;covering [the narrator&rsquo;s] ass,&rdquo; but about opening up the narrative through which the &ldquo;I&rdquo;s of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can speak through. The openness of the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is facilitated by the emptiness and the timelessness of the narrator. The reader-narrator says, &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My body was hollow. It was empty, although it held my shape, and into the contoured vessel the sky came pouring in like a bright blue liquid, and I felt that I had no outside and no inside</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (90-91). And later in the narrative, the writer-narrator says &ldquo;I was in some timeless state, in the past or caught there, seeing beyond memory&rdquo; (212). Foucault argues that writing can &ldquo;create an opening where the writing subject endlessly disappears&rdquo; (116). The narrating subject disappears into the stories it tells. He becomes an emptiness where the internal and external narratives of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are blended and represented. He becomes timeless, where his representation of &ldquo;beyond memory&rdquo; becomes a stage where the significance of the past presently play out. Opening the narrative through the space of the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the shaman becomes a space in which different voices from discontinuous timeframes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are connected, and speak simultaneously.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>The shaman&rsquo;s inscription conjures the unnamed tragedies of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and illuminates the unnamable operation of power. Both are represented through the details of daily life. Each chapter of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is named 月, 火, 水, 木, 金, 土, 日. They are literally Monday to Sunday in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">h&agrave;nz&igrave;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but they also signify yin and yang with the five ancient fundamental elements of fire, water, wood, metal, and earth. Although the order of days is jumbled in the narrative, it comes to a full circle on the last page, written in a clockwise order. It is the micro details of the everyday that reflect the macro-powers looming behind the tragedies. The narrator says, &ldquo;when I heard some distinct word, I would see an image, and when I heard a name I would see a face. If I caught a piece of some anecdote I remembered, I could suddenly see its entirety&mdash;the story of each detail, the secret meanings&rdquo; (208). A word epitomizes an entire story, each name embraces delicate details, and each detail embodies lived narratives: the micro bears the macro. By inscribing the small details, the entire nameless ecosystem of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is conjured out of their reduction into simple figures.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>The vulnerable deaths bear the weight of the macro-power, and the narrator illuminates the substantial political powers that create trivial violences in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The narrator specifically mentions the month of January 1968. On a macro level, January 1968 was particularly hostile. On the 21st, thirty-one North Korean agents invaded Seoul on a mission to assassinate Park Junghee, the South Korean president at the time. On the 23rd, the American spy vessel USS Pueblo got captured off the coast of North Korea. A week later on the 30th and &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">during the Vietnamese New Year celebration of T&ecirc;t, the NVA and the Vietcong simultaneously attacked over a hundred towns, cities, and military installations all over Vietnam. It was the bloodiest offensive of the war</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (131). These macro-historical events were happening on a day-to-day basis, and some trivial violence happens day-to-day parallel to them. The narrator depicts: &ldquo;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GIs were afraid to stay in Korea, but even more afraid that they might be shipped to Cam Ranh Bay to join some counter-offensive against the North Vietnamese. Houseboys and prostitutes were beaten more frequently; there were more fights in the clubs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; (132). This depiction plainly illustrates these workers at the bottom of the Cold War politics. Indeed, the inhabitants of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are indelibly marked and shaped by the tension of the superpowers, of the decisions made in Seoul, Pyongyang, and South Vietnam, by the unexpected tragedies that these distant powers create. The violence against the nameless is filled by stories about them in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, without reducing these figures into a &ldquo;representation of over a million Korean women who [...] worked in prostitution for the US military&rdquo; (Cho 4). In the stories of the narrator, these people are no longer a metaphor. Each detail of the story breathes life into what was once a nameless ghost. They are the ghosts of the Cold War hovering over the daily lives and creating tragedies. The memories are all the more fleeting because the triviality of these tragedies removes them from public discourse that much faster. Macro-powers bombard the every day of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like they do in Nha Trang. Here, each detail flutters in their vulnerability.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>If the narrator can represent both the micro-tragedies and macro-powers in his depiction of the every day, the shamanic inscription of the narrator has two functions. First, the shaman performatively re-presents the forgotten lives that were nonetheless a part of, and sacrificed in, the Cold War ecosystem within </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This connects the absent stories with the present narrative. Second, by not only naming the unnamed deaths but also illuminating the powers that created these deaths, the narrator engages himself in the shamanic activity of exorcism. Then, it is also the case that ghostly presence in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not necessarily just the marginalized lives, but also the macro-powers that dictate the rules of the survival during the Cold War. These powers are indeed ghostly because they function in an invisible place, and in unknowable, unpredictable ways. It is precisely for this reason that the &ldquo;powers&rdquo; cannot be articulated by a more specific word, and for this reason that they cannot be explicitly represented in this narrative. There is nothing to be re-present-ed in forms of &lsquo;memories,&rsquo; as they are never straightforwardly experienced. Here, the shaman connects the power with the powerless, and his role does not stop at rewriting the stories of the unmourned deaths, but extends to protecting the tragedies against being reduced into figures of macrohistory and against being read as metaphors. The double layer of narration represents the tragedies absent from social and public discourses, and goes on to enunciate the powers that created the tragedies and erasure. The shamanic inscription functions to re-present those erased, and illuminates the powers that erase those forgotten. Compared to the ghostly powers, the people of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are irreducibly human in the shaman&rsquo;s narrative. With tangible bodies and flesh, they eat, smoke, and drink PX liquor. They sing, they dance, and they tell stories. Through the stories told in the open space of the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; human voices speak through the ghostly powers.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>Pupyong ASCOM (Army Support Command), the spatial setting of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memories</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is long gone, as most of the complex handed over to the Republic of Korea Ministry of National Defense in 1973 (&ldquo;Camp Market&rdquo;). US Army Garrison Humphreys, located in Pyeongtaek forty miles south of Seoul, includes the US Army&rsquo;s busiest airfield in the Pacific and is the center of the most expansive construction and relocation project in the history of US Department of Defense. It is also the largest overseas US Army post in the world. Under the agreement of both Korean and American governments to move the headquarters of US Forces Korea and United Nations Command to Camp Humphreys, it is estimated that it will become home to 36,000 soldiers (USAG Camp Humphreys). As the USFK prepares its relocation to Camp Humphreys, the clubs and bar girls, most of them from the Philippines now, are also preparing to relocate. The public discourse of this relocation project is either absent, or concentrated on Pyeongtaek&rsquo;s real estate prices. Pyeongtaek is one of the most popular cities to make real estate investments in 2019 (Financial News). Newspaper articles including the keyword &ldquo;gijichon&rdquo; is the highest in 1971, with ninety-two articles total in three major platforms: Kyunghyang, Dong-a, Maeil Business. In 1999, it decreases to thirty-nine (Naver News Library). During Park&rsquo;s regime (1963-1979), it becomes a political and social taboo to represent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in media platforms (Kim). Recently, it is close to impossible to see the word </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in any public platforms. Yet the US Military maintains and flouts its presence on the Korean peninsula, with occasional news on crimes committed by the GIs, or on President Trump&rsquo;s demand that South Korea increase their share of the cost of American troops (&ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s Lose-Lose Proposition in Korea&rdquo;).</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span>The ongoing hostilities on the divided peninsula perhaps assure the legitimacy of the presence of the US troops in the peninsula&rsquo;s southern half. What matters to the literary engagement with the site of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, is not whether the military&rsquo;s presence is legitimate or not. What matters is how one can archive and restore the stories precariously drowning in the well of memories, and how one can represent those unnamed and the unnameable. The narrator says, &ldquo;[the dead] must be so lonely down there in the cold, dark water&rdquo; (191): stories and representation solicidates remembrance, and in remembrance, a community. The shamanic powers of representing memory are indeed performatively palpable and socially discursive. The palimpsestuous reading and writing of the past opens the narrative space to reframe the past as re-readable and re-writable. The plurivocally speaking &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and the multitude of stories illuminate the powers that create and erase the past. This representation cannot resuscitate the dead back into life, but it marks our memorial recognition, and expands the agency of writing.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the insulating layers of both Korean and American ghostly operation of powers silence the voices of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The shaman functions to enable four things. First, the shaman allows a literary engagement of readers with this site. Focusing on the details of the tragedies in the landscape, the dead speaks through the open space of the &ldquo;I.&rdquo; Second, by focusing on the details, the inhabitants of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are not reduced to a metaphor nor are they enfigured: they are conjured as palpable beings with lived human experiences. Third, by depicting the lived experiences at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the shaman illuminates the ghostly presence of powers. The powers are identified as a complex interlaced network of both international and domestic political and economic hostilities. The engagement to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gijichon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through a narrative articulates the stories of the landscape and articulates more than simple victimization and subjugation. Conclusively, the shaman tells the stories, because they are destined to be told. At the intersection of reading and writing, the narrator represents the stories he remembers because they are &ldquo;meant to be told&rdquo; (228). They are meant to be told not just because they are silenced, but because these stories are what render a voice to the silenced, what breathes a life into a person reduced to a figure, and what creates a rupture to the established history of US-Korea relations. The shaman, through storytelling, dismantles the macro-narrative.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>(Winter 2021)</p>',.8746518105849582,"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587718077-51g9lc7h4yl-2.jpg?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 78w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587718077-51g9lc7h4yl-2.jpg?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 157w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587718077-51g9lc7h4yl-2.jpg?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 235w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587718077-51g9lc7h4yl-2.jpg?fm=webp 314w","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587718077-51g9lc7h4yl-2.jpg?dpr=0.25 78w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587718077-51g9lc7h4yl-2.jpg?dpr=0.5 157w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587718077-51g9lc7h4yl-2.jpg?dpr=0.75 235w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587718077-51g9lc7h4yl-2.jpg 314w","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoICAgXFgoLDhgQDhkNGhUVHRUYIx8aJCIfIiEdHysjIiw5KSEiNjUoKC0vMjYyJSU4PTcwPTcxMi8BCgsLBQUFEAUFEC8cFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIABkAFQMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAZAAADAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAYFAwL/xAAhEAAABgEEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIEBREDBhIiMSEyM//EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwDB1tFZc7QthcknZDppCLyN44iWXI/Ji2noxK0VtHiKj0429UAhJvEpLyqAN6ajt7yyIAC8lsRGnoKskESKD8p6BNp0AQeNCXmugBvP9AAP/9k=","reading-and-writing-through-the-layers-of-time","On Stephen King and Roland Barthes","4334732","<p>Reconstructing the Deconstructed Authorship in Stephen King's <em>The Shining</em></p>","INTRODUCTION: PREFATORY MATTERS \nCHAPTER 1.

Reading, Rewriting, Redoing \nCONCLUSION: THE BAD NEWS AND THE GOOD NEWS",'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My MA thesis (2019, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea) analyzes Stephen King&rsquo;s 1977 novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in terms of reading and writing. The spatial setting of the novel, the Overlook hotel, is a place where the past and the present are indistinguishable. Focusing on this inseparable timeframes, this thesis pays attention to the process in which the past and the present becomes destructed through writing, and the ways in which reading can lead the hauntings of the past into a different future. Firstly, this thesis redefines the father-son relationship between Jack and Danny Torrance as that of the writer as a reader. Defining Jack&rsquo;s death in terms of Roland Barthes&rsquo; &ldquo;The Death of the Author&rdquo; (1967), this thesis locates the source of Jack&rsquo;s death in his possessive desire to own and represent the past. However, the past is already in the present, making &lsquo;re-presentation,&rsquo; an act of bringing the past into the present </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">again</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is impossible. Secondly, this thesis anlayzes Danny&rsquo;s shining ability as a reading ability. The shining ability which renders Danny a vision for the past and the future, is defined as the ability to carefully read the unstable signifiers. Danny does not share his father&rsquo;s possessive desire for representation and survives from the Overlook hotel as a reader. This survival gives him a chance to continue his life in the future. However, this thesis pays attention to the fact that Tony, Danny&rsquo;s future self, is already haunted by the past. The name of Tony comes from Danny&rsquo;s abusive grandfather Anthony, and the undesirable past is repeated in the form of the name-inheritance. Lastly, if the signifier of the future is already haunted by the past, the only way to produce newness for the future is to read the past in different ways. This thesis concludes that Danny can read the past in ways that has not been done before, and that he can open up a future that is different from the past, through such reading.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following is an excerpt from the Introduction of the thesis. The full text is available on riss.kr</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines &ldquo;represent&rdquo; as &ldquo;bring into one&rsquo;s presence; bring before the mind; [...] RE + PRESENT&rdquo; (&ldquo;represent&rdquo;). The prefix &lsquo;re-&rsquo; indicates something &ldquo;with the sense &lsquo;again&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;re-&rdquo;). &ldquo;Present&rdquo; derives from &ldquo;presence,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;make [something] present&rdquo; (&ldquo;presence&rdquo;). Going further, &ldquo;presence&rdquo; is constituted by &ldquo;PRE + sēns,&rdquo;: &lsquo;pre,&rsquo; &ldquo;before&rdquo; (&ldquo;pre-&rdquo;) and &lsquo;sēns,&rsquo; &ldquo;feel&rdquo; (&ldquo;sense&rdquo;). Therefore, representation, in terms of writing, refers to the act of making a past feeling come into presence again by reconstructing that feeling with words. It is interesting that none of the definitions of the fragments that make up the word &lsquo;represent&rsquo; are rooted in palpable reality. It is the &ldquo;sense&rdquo; of something present, rather than the &lsquo;fact&rsquo; that is being re-presented. Already in its etymology, this word that has been problematized from Plato through Roland Barthes to Jacques Derrida is exuding a sense of hauntedness. The word &lsquo;representation,&rsquo; in that it is rooted in senses, can easily be explained as an act of re-presenting a feeling that has passed, but somehow remaining in traces, to present it again in the here and now. The act of representation is shaped by the desire to restore the senses of the past into a text; and what is represented is haunted by such senses that surface in the writing process. Therefore, writing, if it is indeed an act of mimesis, cannot be discussed apart from the haunting of the past, or temporalities in general.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>This thesis, reading Stephen King&rsquo;s 1977 novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an allegory of Roland Barthes&rsquo; &ldquo;The Death of an Author,&rdquo; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">##(1)##</span> reconsiders the father-son relationship of Jack and Danny Torrance as that of a writer and a reader. Jack Torrance is an aspiring writer, and Danny is a reader who has just begun to learn how to read. While Jack is destroyed in his obsession to write about the history of the Overlook, Danny survives the haunting powers of that history by reading it in collaboration/cooperation with his mother Wendy, and the head chef of the hotel Dick Hallorann. All three characters who survive have a special ability called &lsquo;shining,&rsquo; which I define as fundamentally the ability to read constantly shifting and mutating signifiers that consist of the seemingly unreadable textuality of the hotel. Ultimately, this thesis aims to interrogate how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warns against the possessive writing of the past, and appeal to the responsibility of the reader in rearranging the signifiers of the past in the present so that it opens up the possibility of moving forward into the future. In this sense, the future is a rereading of the past. The past is already haunting the present, as deeply embedded and vividly resuscitated in the haunted present of the Overlook hotel. What is not so apparent is the ways in which </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> depicts the future as a reflection of the past. Investigating this closely interconnected relationship between the past, the present, and the future, this thesis concludes that the collective and flexible reading of signifiers is a key to reading the past and regenerate its meaning in the present to take us into the future.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> captures the horrors that derive from the unforgotten past which haunts the present, and with the two central characters being a writer and a reader put in the midst of those horrors, exemplifies a situation where the representational activities cannot be separated from temporalities. Indeed, in any representational experience, it is apparent that the text being read in the present has originally been produced in the past. Going back to the hauntedness of representation itself, the text produced in the past in turn embodies in itself the traces of other pasts. Furthermore, because any reading generates interpretations, reading can be understood as a kind of (re)writing. Then, a text produced in the past is not only just read in the present, but it is simultaneously to be reconstituted and rewritten in the future and for the future, although the moment of original inscription would be irrecoverably lost. As such, every text is palimpsestuous. A palimpsest, which means a manuscript or a piece of writing on which old writings have been covered by new writings, serves as an appropriate metaphor in understanding the peculiar timeframe inherent in any literary text. The process of writing and reading the text creates an arena where layers of signs of the past, present, and the future at once come to be accumulated and eventually lose differences from one another. Signifiers are sedimented, and the future can only be imagined in that same arena where the past has an irrepressible existence. In this sense, literary works are inseparably linked to the concepts of time: they are haunted by what has been written, what is being written, and what will be written by all subjects who encounter a text. This is how a text, like an organic being with an agency of its own, comes to trespass and deconstruct the supposed divisions of the past, present, and the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>Accordingly, this thesis explores the question of presentation revolving around the two axes. One is that of the reading and writing, and the other is that of timeframes. As reading, in its production of interpretations, becomes a form of writing, the binary in the axis of reading-writing can no longer be sustained. They are not dichotomously opposing categories, and activities that happen simultaneously. An evident example is Jack&rsquo;s writing of the Overlook&rsquo;s history, which originated in his reading of the haunted hotel&rsquo;s complex and concealed past. Another is Danny&rsquo;s reading of signs that are given to him through the shining, such as REDRUM that he eventually reads it as a murder of himself and Wendy by Jack but comes to write it anew as that of his father. The axis of timeframes is revealed to be all haunted by the past. The past persists into the present at the Overlook, as past events, like the masquerade of 1945, reoccur over and over during the Torrances&rsquo; stay at the hotel. Also, Jack&rsquo;s abusive past, such as breaking Danny&rsquo;s arm in a violent fit of anger, repeat in different forms during their stay. Ultimately, this axis of the past, the present, and the future intersects with the aforementioned axis of reading and writing, because the indistinguishability of reading (the text of the past) and writing (generating new meanings into the future) opens up the possibility that the repetition of the past can be read in different ways by rearranging the signifiers of the past in ways otherwise unknown in the past. In this sense, reading and writing repeat the haunting of the past yet expand it in different directions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>While defining </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a Gothic text is not the central concern of this thesis, it is necessary to situate the issues of deconstructed reading and writing through timeframes in this novel in terms of &lsquo;horror.&rsquo; Perhaps what can define </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a Gothic text is its blatant presence of ghosts. In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literature of Terror</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1996), David Punter argues that &ldquo;the elements which seem most universal in the [Gothic] genre are the apparent presence of a ghost&rdquo; (12). The ghost, who is a revenant from the past, is a representative embodiment of the haunting of the past in the present. Punter, further trying to define gothic literature, argues that &ldquo;the Gothic [has] a way of relating to the real, to historical and psychological facts,&rdquo; which is why &ldquo;Gothic fiction has, above all, to do with terror&rdquo; (12). Gothic, then, has to do with the terror in the idea of the unending past, past that is indistinguishable from the present. This comes to attest that what is terrifying in gothic literature is the persistence and the return of the past. However, the fact that the idea of the past should invoke terror fundamentally suppresses &lsquo;the other,&rsquo; as the past, what is not in the present myself is also a form of the other. This other, the past, constantly invading my present is terrifying, and should be sublimated. By the definition of &lsquo;representation,&rsquo; the suppression of the other that does not belong in the presence is an impossible project in literature: the word already embraces in itself the bombardment of what has passed. In this sense, I argue that the Gothic representation has, above all, to do with deconstruction. It is time to embrace, not terrorize, the deconstructions Gothic fiction has been depicting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>Scholars locate the horror in Stephen King as arising from a certain anxiety about how one thing may not be the thing it seems to be. Regarding King and horror fiction, Bernard J. Gallagher argues that &ldquo;the insight which King offers into the work of horror is based upon a bimodal or dualistic vision which insists upon the necessity of reading between lines&rdquo; (37). The &ldquo;dualistic vision&rdquo; refers to the conventional notion of representation in which a thing is either articulatable or not and it, if the latter, has to be adjusted or compromised according to an acceptable ways of understanding so as to be articulated. However, I do not regard </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a novel that is dictated by such &ldquo;bimodal&rdquo; logic. The ghosts in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appear to the characters in the form of their grotesque, terrifying faces, bodies, and voices. As such, they seem to be recognizable in terms of our conventionally Gothic understanding of them as ghosts. Yet, those ghosts are not fully adjusted or compromised in the conventional gothic manner. What they truly signify is much more than how they look on the surface. Furthermore, the relationship between the signifier and the signified at the Overlook is not one to one. It is one to many. Signifiers are unregulated, unpredictable, and explosive at this haunted hotel. This is why I maintain that what lies at the core of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the deconstruction of the process in writing and reading. Gary Hoppenstand and Ray B. Browne argue that, &ldquo;in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the supernatural motif of the novel is the haunted hotel, but the actual </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">horror</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> elements of the story center more with the disintegration of the Torrance family&rdquo; (6). Yet what causes that &ldquo;disintegration of the Torrance family&rdquo; is the already latent yet increasingly intensified conflict between the writer-Jack and the reader-Danny regarding how to comprehend the &ldquo;horror elements&rdquo; that are the ghostly signifiers of the hotel. Indeed, as Heidi Strengell argues, &ldquo;King has been so concerned with ontology that he constantly writes about multidimensional worlds, universes within universes&rdquo; (19). While the multidimensional world of significances is how the haunting is represented at the Overlook, in the form of mutative timeframes embodied in signifiers, what I read from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is not so much a &ldquo;concern&rdquo; about ontological stability of things, but how a deliberate reading of unstable signifiers can be a means of precarious yet ontological survival itself amidst the inescapable powers of the past.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>Despite its limitation, it is important to reflect upon the deconstructive and reconstructive implication of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in relation with Gothic fiction because the genre has been characterized by doubles and binaries. The issue of this dichotomy is crucial in terms of writing, as the division between the representable and the unrepresentable dictates the logic of representation in Gothic novels. In her decisive work </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Coherency of Gothic Conventions</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1980), Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argues that the futile force trying to reunite the split back into its original unified form is the most vital drive in the Gothic novel. She argues,</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>The self and whatever it is that is outside have a proper, natural, necessary connection to each other, but one that the self is suddenly incapable of making. The inside life and the outside life have to continue separately, becoming counterparts rather than partners, the relationship between them one of parallels and correspondences rather than communication. This, though it may happen in an instant, is a fundamental reorganization, creating a doubleness where singleness should be. And the lengths there are to go to reintegrate the sundered elements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;finally, the impossibility of restoring them to their original oneness&mdash;are the most characteristic energies of the Gothic novel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (13)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>The spatial division of the inside and outside cannot be unified in Gothic literature, and Sedgwick identifies the Freudian psychoanalysis as the locus of such dichotomous critical convention of the genre. She says: &ldquo;[i]n congruence with this [i.e. divided between the inner and the outer] map of the self, critics of the Gothic, and not only those who describe themselves as psychoanalytic, find it easy to group together on the one hand the surface, reason, and repression and on the other the depths, the irrational, and the sexual&rdquo; (142). However, I stress that, in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is not the &ldquo;repression&rdquo; that leads to unrepresentability. It is the always-already haunting presence of the past that makes representation impossible: naturally, one cannot bring into presence what is already present. Again, the binary between the representable and the unrepresentable in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is deconstructed by the inherent persistence of the past.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>Reading and writing through the layers of time, the reader and the writer come to be in&ldquo;separately&rdquo; related to one another. Putting Sedgwick&rsquo;s argument in terms of reading and writing, writing can be equated to the &ldquo;inside life&rdquo; which refers to an expression of the inner self, and reading can be equated to the &ldquo;outside life&rdquo; as the text to be read lies outside to the self and is heterogenous to the self. Sedgwick articulates that &ldquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the most characteristic energies of the Gothic novel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; is rooted in the impossibility of reconciling the &ldquo;counterparts&rdquo; of &ldquo;the inside life and the outside life&rdquo;(13). However, when the axis of reading and writing is placed in the center of discussing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the two seemingly opposing activities of reading and writing indeed &ldquo;reorganize&rdquo; themselves into a &ldquo;communicative&rdquo; relationship. Then, understanding </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the axes of reading and writing and time not only deconstructs the division of the two textual activities and of the past-present-future, but it also reconstructs the categories previously thought to be irreconcilable as in fact interdependent and incessantly haunting and influencing one another. Jodey Castricano conceptualizes writing in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptomimesis </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2001) as follows: &ldquo;writing [...] is learning to let the plurivocal spirit speak, a task which is the gothic equivalent of pursuing a phantom through labyrinthine vaults, being led onwards by the echoes of footsteps&rdquo; (120). However, in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is the reader who learns to speak in such &ldquo;plurivocal spirit&rdquo; while the writer deteriorates in his own obsession with authority. And this reader generates meanings like a writer. Reading and writing become a simultaneous process.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>In response to various issues of representation as examined above, the thesis presents a discussion of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the following structure. The first chapter deals with Jack as a writer, exploring the ways in which writing can be understood in terms of playing<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(1)</span>. Despite some apparent resonances between the two activities as pointed out by both Freud and Barthes, writing and playing can potentially be a dangerously combined attempt when the textual material is the past. To do this, I first focus on the fact that Jack wishes to write a play about his personal past, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Little School</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The play-writing is significant because Jack is later possessed by the Overlook and reduced to an agent of the autonomy the hotel exerts over him. In other words, he attempts to play with his own past only to be played by the Overlook&rsquo;s past. Moving onto the concept of writing as representation, I probe into why Jack is inevitably destroyed in his desire to write, yet avoid framing this destruction simply as a writerly failure. Instead, I identify the locus of Jack&rsquo;s destruction as his obsession with the futile idea of Author-ity. Authority in this sense is the control an author has over his textual material, the power to authoritatively produce a new narrative. Jack is rejected having this power, because the past, his primary inspiration, is essentially ungraspable and inescapably haunting. Then, Jack&rsquo;s &lsquo;failure&rsquo; is not a personal failure but a failure inherent in writing as a representation. Se&agrave;n Burke argues that &ldquo;[w]hat Roland Barthes has been talking of all along is not the death of the author, but the closure of representation&rdquo; (48). In the case of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the author literally dies, because representation cannot happen in the haunted hotel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>The second chapter analyzes Danny as a reader. Danny begins by being a reader who is terrified by the fact that signs can mutate. Due to his shining ability, he witnesses certain signifiers like a perfectly ordinary hotel door can mutate into an unexpected signified that hides a not so ordinary, haunted room inside with a bloated corpse of a lady. He also learns to read in order to please the authoritative writer, who happens to be the authoritative member of his family: his father. However, Danny in the end realizing that the meanings embedded in certain signifiers can indeed shift, and that reading these shifting signifieds is a way to escape the Overlook&rsquo;s inescapably haunting powers. He becomes capable to read the signifiers and rewrites them according to the meanings required for his survival. In this discussion of Danny, I steer away from understanding him as a child hero. As his middle name repeats the abusive figure of Anthony, who also shares the name with Danny&rsquo;s future self Tony, Danny inherits a piece of the past in himself regardless of his will. In this sense, he is neither young, nor is he a hero. Yet it is ironic that this seemingly powerless and decentralized character, which embodies a certain undesired past, is telepathic with the future, and has comes to secure a future for himself through his survival. This chapter focuses on how reading-writing and past-present-future are deconstructed. These deconstructions derive from the indistinguishable divisions between the two representational activities and the timeframes. Lastly, this chapter concludes that the future is already haunted by the past, which renders reading-rewriting as a viable means to change the significations of sinister repetition of the past.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </i>The ultimate purpose of this thesis is to show how reading is writing, and how the future is already rooted in the past. The repetition of the past is in fact an omnipresent condition and not a horrifying state. The past has inescapable powers, and the dead is always already alive at the Overlook. I propose to think about the future as a rearrangement of textual signs, or signifiers. It is such rearrangement that allows a construction of the future. As Derrida argues in &ldquo;Signature Event Context&rdquo; (1988), every sign can be &ldquo;put between quotation marks; in so doing it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable&rdquo; (12) <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">##(2)##</span>. The future is none other than the illimitably generated new contexts. This construction is, however, essentially a reconstruction: it is not an &ldquo;absolutely new&rdquo; that eschatologically breaks off from the past, but it is cyclical, because haunting is a semiotic condition in which signs are inescapably circulated among themselves. Understanding this repetition of time foremost as a textual phenomenon opens up a mode of rearranging, reconstructing, and reimagining the future: and the prefix &lsquo;re-&rsquo; already manifests that the future, as much as the present, is related to the past. The harm of repetition of time is not healed but rehabilitated through reading and writing, by the replacement and displacement of signifiers. It could not, and should not, be healed, but still would be liberating. The ever-repeated presence of the past can be undone and redone through textual activities of reading and writing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Winter 2019)</span></p>',"Reconstructing the Deconstructed Authorship in Stephen King's The Shining","#ac1a27",1.6257408975444538,"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587713875-elresplandor-604938383-large.jpg?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 480w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587713875-elresplandor-604938383-large.jpg?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 960w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587713875-elresplandor-604938383-large.jpg?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 1440w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587713875-elresplandor-604938383-large.jpg?fm=webp 1920w","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587713875-elresplandor-604938383-large.jpg?dpr=0.25 480w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587713875-elresplandor-604938383-large.jpg?dpr=0.5 960w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587713875-elresplandor-604938383-large.jpg?dpr=0.75 1440w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587713875-elresplandor-604938383-large.jpg 1920w","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoICAgLFhYLDg4QDg0NDh0OFhEOFxUZGCIfIhUaHysjGh0oHSEiJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLDg0OHBAQHDsoIig7Lzs7Ozs1Oy81LzsvLy81Ly8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIAA8AGAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAXAAADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwYE/8QAHhAAAAYCAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwQRBSESMTL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAv/EABgRAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhEh/9oADAMBAAIRAxEAPwBbk5CN2GMZduqshKTJS+OjGaM84Z+jBNqEZiyqn5FCi7AJGfLcQgzsAk7LKLP/2Q==","4620985","Derrida, Jacques. “This Strange Institution Called Literature.” Acts of Literature , edited by Derek Attridge, Routledge, 1992.",'<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before talking about whether the subaltern can speak, I ask, can we listen to the subaltern? If we can, then I want to ask, can the subaltern be represented? Lastly, if language indeed has a performative power, can representation performative reshape the social existence of certain memories and beings? Can literature play a critical role in representing memories that have long been silenced?</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My research centers around the idea of literature "as a strange institution which allows one to say everything" (Jacques Derrida, 1992), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and I read a certain explosive power in the idea that it can say "everything." Literature, to me, is something that stands at the intersection of social urgency and representation. I strive to navigate these axes by which any literary work is constructed, and deconstructed, the most central idea being that there is political power in the act of (un)representation itself. In this, I am always more interested in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what the text </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, instead of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">operate</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there than where they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stand</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engaging with memories as a text media, I work to involve literature in historical and sociological sites in order to expand the discipline to render palpable political powers to literature as an act of activism. Literature, as a delicate tool, can narrativize the histories of disappearing communities, archive the stories of underrepresented communities, and circulate these memories to preserve them. Exploring various means and meanings of representation functions as defiance against social erasure, and such exploration not only allows us to access and assess the complex narratives of the forgotten memories, but also to analyze the ways in which these narratives continue to haunt and shape the present.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Alex Heeyeon Kil, 2022.</span></p>',"Before talking about whether the subaltern can speak, I ask, can we listen to the subaltern?","#c5ac3c",.6626686656671664,"https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588083224-img9791-2.jpg?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 221w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588083224-img9791-2.jpg?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 442w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588083224-img9791-2.jpg?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 663w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588083224-img9791-2.jpg?fm=webp 884w","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588083224-img9791-2.jpg?dpr=0.25 221w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588083224-img9791-2.jpg?dpr=0.5 442w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588083224-img9791-2.jpg?dpr=0.75 663w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588083224-img9791-2.jpg 884w","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoICAgLCg0XDhENFQUNDh0VDhUYFxUgGBYVIhUmJSsjGh0oHSEiJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLDg0OHBAQHDUcIig7Ozs7Oy8vLy87Lzs7Oy87NTsvLy8vLy8vOy87Oy81Ly8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIABkAEAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAXAAADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBQYD/8QAHRAAAQMFAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABBQMEETEyEv/EABcBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBQH/xAAZEQEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIRIQP/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AN5u2erTwp8I8mbGFX3rgQpeIhlTindmFdYFeSfkdoClLs5bQ8hw6U2/bp7yoIwiYk//2Q==","Writer's Statement ","https://www.okok.services/","Website by","okok.services","On Durebang","유난히 따뜻했던 2019년의 두레방 데이","(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587995277-screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-10-47-15-pm.png?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 148w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587995277-screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-10-47-15-pm.png?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 297w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587995277-screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-10-47-15-pm.png?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 445w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587995277-screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-10-47-15-pm.png?fm=webp 594w","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587995277-screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-10-47-15-pm.png?dpr=0.25 148w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587995277-screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-10-47-15-pm.png?dpr=0.5 297w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587995277-screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-10-47-15-pm.png?dpr=0.75 445w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587995277-screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-10-47-15-pm.png 594w","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoICAgLCgoLDhgOGg0NDhQWDRUdHRoZGBYTFhUaHysjGh0oHRUWJDUlKC0vMjIyGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLBQUFEAUFEC8cFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIAAgAGAMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAWAAEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgP/xAAcEAACAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQUCAwQSIQb/xAAUAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ao6PPR7fWbVwUdbo4wAJmYxMW03owAB//2Q==","On Flowers Blooming at Auschwitz","쥐, 고양이, 아우슈비츠, 민들레","#b4b4b4",.7426221577164973,"(max-width: 1535px) 100vw, 1535px","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587994101-maus.jpg?dpr=0.25&fm=webp 383w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587994101-maus.jpg?dpr=0.5&fm=webp 767w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587994101-maus.jpg?dpr=0.75&fm=webp 1151w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587994101-maus.jpg?fm=webp 1535w","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587994101-maus.jpg?dpr=0.25 383w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587994101-maus.jpg?dpr=0.5 767w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587994101-maus.jpg?dpr=0.75 1151w,https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587994101-maus.jpg 1535w","data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wCEAAoHBwgHBgoTEQgLEA8VDhYOGA4NEBIOFhEYFxMZGBYfIhUmHysjGh0oHSEWJDUlKC0vMj4yGSI4PTcwPCsxMi8BCgsLBQUFEAUFEC8cFhwvLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vLy8vL//AABEIABkAEgMBIgACEQEDEQH/xAAZAAEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFAAYBAgf/xAAjEAACAQIEBwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDBAUSUXETFBUhIjEz/8QAFAEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP/EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AOYW1k4yF6Vo8hrSUc6FqSjwwDuWZgQ8SAVKGKpTXsZpYknSXcqYlbfBbAMdSWpAYgH/2Q==","The Unfathomable Words of the Subaltern","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1643732859-0001_1.jpg","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720780-images-1.jpeg","“(Old Father, Old Artificer,) Stand me Now and Ever In Good Stead”","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1587720978-enu6dpf3bei6dnxycqjw24iplm.jpeg","nothing","https://www.datocms-assets.com/24045/1588351567-img9791-2-edited-edited.png")</script><script src="/_nuxt/610cd42.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/0677b9c.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/08d2df4.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/a9d0d5e.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/60a6c8d.js" defer></script>
